Zi Gong asked, saying, "Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?" The Master said, "Is not RECIPROCITY such a word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others."

All participants in the experiment read a short passage asking them to imagine being the passenger in a car when the driver of the vehicle causes an accident. Two components of this short passage varied according to experimental condition. One variable concerned the identity of the driver causing the accident: either one’s father, one’s taxi cab driver, or one’s supervisor at work. A second variable concerned the resulting consequences of the imaginary accident: either property damage to someone else’s car, bodily injury of a pedestrian, or vehicular manslaughter of a pedestrian. In all cases, the driver speeds away. Participants were drawn from both Chinese and Western populations, and were asked the same set of questions (in Chinese or English), which revolved around moral psychology. For example, they were asked “How ashamed would you feel if you turned in the driver to the civil authorities, and other people found out that you did so?” and “How morally wrong do you believe was the driver’s actions?” Answers to these and other questions were collected on a scale, meaning that participants were not forced into answering yes or no questions.

对亲人，因为血缘和长久的一起居住，你可能可以体谅对方。

对身边的陌生人，你需要在意他人的看法，因此会收敛一点，装作翩翩君子。

对网络那边的陌生人，你无须害怕被人指责，因为没人知道你是谁。

## 《[孟子 - Mengzi](https://ctext.org/mengzi/ens)》

离娄下:	
孟子曰：“君子所以异于人者，以其存心也。==君子以仁存心，以礼存心。仁者爱人，有礼者敬人。爱人者人恒爱之，敬人者人恒敬之。==有人于此，其待我以横逆，则君子必自反也：我必不仁也，必无礼也，此物奚宜至哉？其自反而仁矣，自反而有礼矣，其横逆由是也，君子必自反也：我必不忠。自反而忠矣，其横逆由是也，君子曰：‘此亦妄人也已矣。如此则与禽兽奚择哉？于禽兽又何难焉？’是故君子有终身之忧，无一朝之患也。乃若所忧则有之：舜人也，我亦人也。舜为法于天下，可传于后世，我由未免为乡人也，是则可忧也。忧之如何？如舜而已矣。若夫君子所患则亡矣。非仁无为也，非礼无行也。如有一朝之患，则君子不患矣。”
Li Lou II:	
Mencius said, 'That whereby the superior man is distinguished from other men is what he preserves in his heart - namely, benevolence and propriety. ==The benevolent man loves others. The man of propriety shows respect to others. He who loves others is constantly loved by them. He who respects others is constantly respected by them.== Here is a man, who treats me in a perverse and unreasonable manner. The superior man in such a case will turn round upon himself, "I must have been wanting in benevolence; I must have been wanting in propriety - how should this have happened to me?" He examines himself, and is specially benevolent. He turns round upon himself, and is specially observant of propriety. The perversity and unreasonableness of the other, however, are still the same. The superior man will again turn round on himself, "I must have been failing to do my utmost." He turns round upon himself, and proceeds to do his utmost, but still the perversity and unreasonableness of the other are repeated. On this the superior man says, "This is a man utterly lost indeed! Since he conducts himself so, what is there to choose between him and a brute? Why should I go to contend with a brute?" Thus it is that the superior man has a life-long anxiety and not one morning's calamity. As to what is matter of anxiety to him, that indeed be has. He says, "Shun was a man, and I also am a man. But Shun became an example to all the kingdom, and his conduct was worthy to be handed down to after ages, while I am nothing better than a villager." This indeed is the proper matter of anxiety to him. And in what way is he anxious about it? Just that he maybe like Shun: then only will he stop. As to what the superior man would feel to be a calamity, there is no such thing. He does nothing which is not according to propriety. If there should befall him one morning's calamity, the superior man does not account it a calamity.'

曰：“挟太山以超北海，语人曰‘我不能’，是诚不能也。为长者折枝，语人曰‘我不能’，是不为也，非不能也。故王之不王，非挟太山以超北海之类也；王之不王，是折枝之类也。==老吾老，以及人之老；幼吾幼，以及人之幼。==天下可运于掌。《诗》云：‘刑于寡妻，至于兄弟，以御于家邦。’言举斯心加诸彼而已。故推恩足以保四海，不推恩无以保妻子。古之人所以大过人者无他焉，善推其所为而已矣。今恩足以及禽兽，而功不至于百姓者，独何与？权，然后知轻重；度，然后知长短。物皆然，心为甚。王请度之！抑王兴甲兵，危士臣，构怨于诸侯，然后快于心与？”

Mencius replied,'In such a thing as taking the Tai mountain under your arm, and leaping over the north sea with it, if you say to people "I am not able to do it," that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people "I am not able to do it," that is a case of not doing it, it is not a case of not being able to do it. Therefore your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway, is not such a case as that of taking the Tai mountain under your arm, and leaping over the north sea with it. Your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree. ==Treat with the reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that the elders in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that the young in the families of others shall be similarly treated== - do this, and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the Book of Poetry, "His example affected his wife. It reached to his brothers, and his family of the State was governed by it." The language shows how king Wen simply took his kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out his kindness of heart by a prince will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas, and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men, was no other but this - simply that they knew well how to carry out, so as to affect others, what they themselves did. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and no benefits are extended from it to reach the people. How is this? Is an exception to be made here? By weighing, we know what things are light, and what heavy. By measuring, we know what things are long, and what short. The relations of all things may be thus determined, and it is of the greatest importance to estimate the motions of the mind. I beg your Majesty to measure it. You collect your equipments of war, endanger your soldiers and officers, and excite the resentment of the other princes - do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?'
