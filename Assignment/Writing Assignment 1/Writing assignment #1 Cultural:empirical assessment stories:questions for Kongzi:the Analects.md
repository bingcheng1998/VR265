# Writing assignment #1 

**Cultural/empirical assessment stories/questions for Kongzi/the Analects**



Based on the philosophical readings from Kongzi/the Analects, you will formulate stories/questions – or analyze the occurrence and/or co-occurrence of to assess the extent to which individuals would subscribe to cultural variants – for example, ideas, beliefs, and values – touched on in the readings. In other words, ==you should identify empirical claims made by the texts and develop means of assessing these claims.==  

These should be at least two pages but no longer than four pages – Times New Roman 12-point font, 1-inch margins, no more than double spaced. You should include an introduction with a thesis statement, stating what you’ve done and why, as well as a plan of development, outlining what you’re doing where.

You will be assessed on **form** as much as **content – i.e., that your writing follows the conventions of the English language and are free of punctuation, grammar, and syntactical mistakes.** Check the **guidelines/grading criteria** for your written work posted on Canvas: [Guidelines-grading criteria for your written work.pdf](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128094/download?wrap=1)[![在新窗口中查看](https://umjicanvas.com/images/popout.png)](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128094/download?wrap=1) [Writing guidelines:corresponding pages in the EDW.pdf](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128096/download?wrap=1)[![在新窗口中查看](https://umjicanvas.com/images/popout.png)](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128096/download?wrap=1) [Guide to abbreviations.pdf](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128095/download?wrap=1)[![在新窗口中查看](https://umjicanvas.com/images/popout.png)](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128095/download?wrap=1)

If writing is especially troublesome for you, then I encourage you to seek help from the JI’s Writing Center.

 All late work will be penalized **ten-percentage points** per day. No papers handed in more than **four** days late will be accepted. **Always both submit e-versions and bring hardcopies to class.** 

 These writing assignments are based on the ideas, methodology, and procedure described in “Chinese Philosophy as Experimental Philosophy.” For that reason, if you don’t understand what you’re supposed to do/are confused, then please reread that article. Additionally, I’ve copied and pasted sections of that article below, which deal with the methodology/procedure described therein, which you could

 **The general idea**: “…a couple of case studies concerning how one might use experimental methods to explore the Chinese intellectual tradition.

(0) In an objective and systematic fashion, determine (the extent to which) cultural and moral values present in ancient Chinese texts – a ‘big data’/digital humanities approach – explore the extent and relations between value terms in Chinese philosophical texts]

(1)  Test for the impact of internalized Chinese social/philosophical culture: Subjects appropriate for this study would be drawn from East Asian societies inheriting Confucian cultural and moral values [or other cultural variants such as norms or beliefs, conditioned by socially transmitted information], such as China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. [=subjects whose behaviors are influenced by “Chinese” culture]

(2)  Test specific philosophical claims that appear in the philosophical tradition itself, such as claims concerning the nature of moral judgment or the effects of observing ritual propriety.

In what follows, we will give examples of both types of projects, using two of Confucianism’s most distinctive features as test cases—filial piety and ritual propriety” (358).

 **The general procedure**:

1. Find parts of the readings that make an empirical(ly testable) claim regarding, for example, how people understand and/or use terms, or would behave
2. Create a vignette/story and questions
3. Consider and explain a hypothesis and predict results

 **An example from the text**:

1. **Find parts of the readings that make an empirical(ly testable) claim regarding, for example, how people understand and/or use terms, or would behave:** “13.18 The Duke of She said to Confucius [叶公语孔子曰], ‘Among my people there is one we call “Upright Gong” [‘吾党有直躬者]. When his father stole a sheep, he reported him to the authorities’ [其父攘羊，而子证之’]. Confucius replied [孔子曰], ‘Among *my people*[those from the state of Lu/embodying Chinese culture/practicing li 礼], those who *we consider*[how we think about/apply this concept] “upright” [直] are different from this [‘吾党之直者异于是]: fathers cover up for their sons, and sons cover up for their fathers [父为子隐，子为父隐]. “Uprightness” is to be found in this’ [直在其中矣’] ” (Slingerland 2003a: 147)” (358 – emphasis added).

2. **Create a vignette/story and questions:** “Nichols et al. (2016) designed an experiment that duplicated several key features of the case of Upright Gong, focusing not specifically on stealing but on other immoral behavior [DID NOT ask about stealing sheep…]. All participants in the experiment read a short passage asking them to imagine being the passenger in a car when the driver of the vehicle causes an accident. Two components of this short passage varied according to experimental condition. One variable concerned the identity of the driver causing the accident: either one’s father, one’s taxi cab driver, or one’s supervisor at work. A second variable concerned the resulting consequences of the imaginary accident: either property damage to someone else’s car, bodily injury of a pedestrian, or vehicular man slaughter of a pedestrian. In all cases, the driver speeds away. Participants were drawn from both Chinese and Western populations, and were asked the same set of questions (in Chinese or English), which revolved around moral psychology. For example, they were asked ‘How ashamed would you feel if you turned in the driver to the civil authorities, and other people found out that you did so?’ and ‘How morally wrong do you believe was the driver’s actions?’ Answers to these and other questions were collected on a scale, meaning that participants were not forced into answering yes or no questions” (359 – emphasis added).

3. **Consider and explain a hypothesis and predict results:** “…one must craft principled *reasons*to hypothesize that a specific, testable answer is true. To illustrate, one of the hypotheses of this research was that *Chinese participants would express more filial piety than American participants by being more willing to conceal the crimes of their fathers* [as a result of culture – socially transmitted information]” (359 – emphasis added). “Results confirmed the hypotheses that Chinese participants were significantly more influenced by *filial piety*[fathers] and by authority [supervisors] in their moral psychological reasoning. This can be illustrated by using data from the question ‘How willing would you be to conceal this offense?’ Across all conditions, Chinese were much more willing to conceal the driver’s crime than were American participants. In particular, even though both Chinese and American participants were more willing to conceal the crimes of their fathers than, say, the crimes of their taxi drivers, Chinese participants were much more willing to do so (Nichols et al. 2016)” (359 – emphasis added)
