Chapter Twenty-Three: Human Nature is Bad

> Page284

People’s nature is bad. Their goodness is a matter of deliberate effort. 

crooked wood must await steaming and straightening on the shap-
ing frame, and only then does it become straight. Blunt metal must await
honing and grinding, and only then does it become sharp.

> page285

Mengzi says: When people engage in learning, this manifests the goodness of their nature. I say: This is not so. This is a case of not attaining knowledge of people’s nature and of not inspecting clearly the division between people’s nature and their deliberate efforts. In every case, the nature of a thing is the accomplishment of Heaven. It cannot be learned. It cannot be worked at. Ritual and the standards of righteousness are what the sage produces. They are things that people become capable of through learning, things that are achieved through working at them. Those things in people that cannot be learned and cannot be worked at are called their “nature.” Those things in people that they become capable of through learning and that they achieve through working at them are called their “deliberate efforts.” This is the di- vision between nature and deliberate effort.(Ivanhoe & Norden, 285)　孟子说：“人要求学习的，就是人性的善。”这是错误的！这是因为不曾懂得人性，不了解本性与后天人为之间的区别。本性，是天生的，是学习不来的，也不是后天人为的。礼义，是圣人制定的，通过学习人们就能得到，经过努力就能做到。不可能通过学习，也不可能是人为，而是先天自然生成的，这就是本性。可以通过学习获得，可以经过后天人为的努力实现的，就是人为。这就是本性与人为的差别。

Mengzi says: People’s nature is good, but they all wind up losing their nature and original state (Ivanhoe & Norden, 286).

 if men suddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they will without exception experience a feeling of alarm and distress... the feeling of commiseration is essential to man. 今人乍见孺子将入于井，皆有怵惕恻隐之心...无恻隐之心，非人也(Mengzi, Gong Sun Chou I)
