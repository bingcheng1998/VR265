写一篇关于庄子，荀子和韩非子思想的文章。

您的主题应该关注其工作的文化含义，例如参考规范，价值观和/或信仰。务必确定经验主张并明确定义论文中出现的任何术语。我建议你遵循一般的方法/程序作为较短的写作任务。

这篇文章应该是至少五页但不超过六页 - Times New Roman 12磅字体，1英寸边距，不超过两倍。你应该在论文中加入一篇论文，以及一份发展计划，概述你在做什么。

Write an essay on the thought of Zhuangzi, Xunzi, and Hanfeizi.

Your topic should focus on the cultural implications of their work, making reference to, for example, norms, values and/or beliefs. Be sure to identify empirical claims and clearly define any terminology that appears in your essay. I'd suggest you follow the general methodology/procedure as the shorter writing assignments.

The essay should be at least five but no longer than six pages – Times New Roman 12-point font, 1-inch margins, no more than double spaced. You should include an introduction with a thesis statement, as well as a plan of development, outlining what you’re doing where.

You will be assessed on **form** as much as **content – i.e., that your writing follows the conventions of the English language and are free of punctuation, grammar, and syntactical mistakes.** Check the **guidelines/grading criteria** for your written work posted on Canvas: [Guidelines-grading criteria for your written work.pdf](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128094/download?wrap=1)[![View in a new window](https://umjicanvas.com/images/popout.png)](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128094/download?wrap=1) [Writing guidelines:corresponding pages in the EDW.pdf](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128096/download?wrap=1)[![View in a new window](https://umjicanvas.com/images/popout.png)](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128096/download?wrap=1) [Guide to abbreviations.pdf](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128095/download?wrap=1)[![View in a new window](https://umjicanvas.com/images/popout.png)](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/841/files/128095/download?wrap=1)
