12.11 齐景公问政于孔子。孔子对曰：“君君，臣臣，父父，子子。”公曰：“善哉！信如君不君，臣不臣，父不父，子不子，虽有粟，吾得而食诸？”

Duke Jing of Qi asked Kongzi about governing.

Kongzi responded, “Let the ruler be a true ruler, the ministers true ministers, the fathers true fathers, and the sons true sons.”

The Duke replied, “Well put! Certainly if the ruler is not a true ruler, the ministers not true ministers, the fathers not true fathers, and the sons not true sons, even if there is sufficient grain, will I ever get to eat it?”
