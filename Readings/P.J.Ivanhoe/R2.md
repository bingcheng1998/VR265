### Introduction 

The Analects ( Lunyu )* —literally, the “Classified Teachings”) purports to be a record of the teachings of Kongzi +! or “Confucius” (551–479 B . C . E .) and his disciples. 1 Kongzi believed that the Golden Age of hu- mankind had been realized during the height of Zhou dynasty, from c. 1045–771 B . C . E . (the so-called Western Zhou period). Personified by the cultural heroes King Wen (d.c. 1050 B . C . E .), his son King Wu (r. 1045– 1043) and the virtuous regent, the Duke of Zhou (r. c. 1043–1036 B . C . E .), the early Zhou rulers established and maintained a special relationship with tian $ , “Heaven,” by properly and sincerely observing a set of sacred prac- tices collectively referred to as the li , , “rites” or “rituals.” The scope of the rites was quite vast, including everything from grand state ceremonies to the proper way to sit or fasten one’s lapel—details that we might think of as issues of etiquette. In return for such formal obedience to Heaven in all matters great and small, the Zhou royal line was rewarded with a ming % , 1 Some scholars have questioned the traditional view of the text as a unified work, argu- ing that it represents many different chronological strata and even incompatible viewpoints. The Chinese have nevertheless read it as a coherent whole for thousands of years, and this is the perspective on the text that we adopt here. This said, the reader will note that our se- lection gives greater weight to those portions of the text generally agreed to be earlier and most authoritative, Books 1–9.

2 ■ kongzi (confucius) “Mandate,” 2 to rule China, manifested in the form of a charismatic de - , “Virtue,” or power. By Kongzi’s age, the Zhou kings had been reduced to mere figureheads, and real political power was in the hands of various local rulers. In Kongzi’s eyes, the “scholars” of his day—those who should properly be motivated by a love for learning and a devotion to the culture of the Zhou—were inter- ested only in self-aggrandizement and sensuous pleasures, and the people, thereby bereft of moral leadership and grown unruly, could only be con- trolled through strict laws and harsh punishments. Despite the bleakness of this world, Kongzi believed that there was still hope for humanity, because the traditional Zhou ritual forms and written classics—which had been carefully preserved by a small group of cultural specialists, the ru . , “Eru- dites,” 3 —could serve as a sort of blueprint for rebuilding the lost Golden Age. Kongzi thus dedicated his life to both transmitting these cultural forms to his contemporaries and striving to embody them in his own per- son, hoping in this way to lead his fallen world back to the dao / , “Way,” of Heaven. Involving lifelong and sincere devotion to traditional cultural forms, Kongzi’s Way is to culminate eventually in a kind of intuitive mastery of those forms, and one who has attained this state of consummate mastery— the junzi 0! , “gentleman”—is said to possess the supreme virtue of ren 1 , “true humaneness” or “humanity.” Originally referring to the strong and handsome appearance of a noble warrior, ren designates for Kongzi the qual- ity of the perfectly realized person—one who has so completely mastered the Way that it has become a sort of second nature. Such a state of spiritual perfection is referred to as wuwei 23 , “effortless action” or “nonaction”: a state of spontaneous harmony between individual inclinations and the sa- cred Way of Heaven. Through the power of Virtue accruing to one so per- fectly in harmony with Heaven, this state of individual perfection is to lead to the spontaneous and effortless ordering of the entire world. There will be no need for raising armies, instituting laws, or issuing governmental decrees, for the entire world will be as inexorably drawn to a ruler with true Virtue as the heavenly bodies are bound to their proper circuits in the sky. 2 By the time of the Analects , the term ming had taken on the additional meaning of “fate” or “destiny,” but was thought to be similarly decreed by Heaven. For a discussion of this term, see Edward (Ted) Slingerland, “The Conception of Ming in Early Chinese Thought,” Philosophy East & West 46.4 (1996), pp. 567–81. 3 See Important Terms and Analects 6.13 for Kongzi’s criticism of the “petty ru .”

The analects ■ 3

Book One 1.1 The Master said, “To study, and then in a timely fashion to practice what you have learned—is this not satisfying? To have companions arrive from afar—is this not a joy? To remain unrecognized by others and yet re- main free of resentment—is this not the mark of the gentleman?” 1.2 Youzi 4 said, “It is unlikely that one who has grown up as a filial son and respectful younger brother will then be inclined to defy his superiors, and there has never been a case of one who is disinclined to defy his superiors stirring up a rebellion. “The gentleman applies himself to the roots. Once the roots are firmly planted, the Way will grow therefrom. Might we thus say that filiality and brotherly respect represent the root of ren ?” 1.3 The Master said, “A glib tongue and an ingratiating manner are rarely signs of ren .” 5 1.6 The Master said, “A student should be filial toward his parents when at home and respectful toward his elders when abroad. Careful in action and truthful in speech, he should display an expansive care for the multitude and seek to draw near to those who are ren . If in the course of his duties he finds himself with energy to spare, he should devote it to study of the wen 4 , ‘cultural arts.’” 1.9 Zengzi 6 said, “Be meticulous in observing the passing of those close to you and do not fail to continue the sacrifices to your distant ancestors. This will be enough to cause the Virtue of the people to return to fullness.” 1.10 Ziqin said to Zigong, 7 “When our Master arrives in a state, he invari- ably finds out about its government. Does he actively seek out this infor- mation? Surely it is not simply offered to him!” 4 A disciple of Kongzi. 5 A suspicion of those who are overly glib or outwardly pleasing is a common theme in the Analects . In Analects 15.11, the danger presented by ningren 5é , “glib people,” is compared to the derangement of morals brought about by the decadent music of the state of Zheng. 6 A disciple of Kongzi. 7 Both disciples of Kongzi.

4 ■ kongzi (confucius) Zigong answered, “Our Master acquires it through being cordial, good, respectful, frugal, and deferential. The Master’s way of seeking it is rather different from other people’s way of seeking it, is it not?” 8 1.12 Youzi said, “In the application of ritual, it is harmonious ease 9 that is to be valued. It is precisely such harmony that makes the Way of the For- mer Kings so beautiful. If you merely stick rigidly to ritual in all matters, great and small, there will remain that which you cannot accomplish. Yet if you know enough to value harmonious ease but try to attain it without being regulated by the rites, this will not work either.” 1.15 Zigong said, “Poor and yet not obsequious, rich and yet not arro- gant—what would you say about someone like that?” The Master answered, “That is acceptable, but it is not as good as being poor and yet full of joy, rich and yet fond of ritual.” Zigong said, “In the Odes we read, As if cut, as if polished; As if carved, as if ground. 10 Is this not what you have in mind?” 11 The Master said, “Zigong, you are precisely the kind of person with whom one can begin to discuss the Odes . Informed as to what has gone be- fore, you know what is to come.” Book Two 2.1 The Master said, “One who rules through the power of Virtue might be compared to the Pole Star, which simply remains in its place while re- ceiving the homage of the myriad lesser stars.” 8 That is, Kongzi does not actively pry or seek out information, but rather is so perfected in Virtue that what he seeks comes to him unbidden, in a wuwei fashion. 9 That is, a state of he 7 , “harmony,” between inner emotions and outward form. 10 Mao # 55. 11 That is, a person whose character has been arduously shaped and perfectly transformed in such a manner.

The analects ■ 5 2.2 The Master said, “The three hundred poems in the Odes can be judged with a single phrase: ‘Oh, they will not lead you astray.’” 12 2.3 The Master said, “If you try to lead the common people with govern- mental regulations and keep them in line with punishments, the laws will simply be evaded and the people will have no sense of shame. If, however, you guide them with Virtue, and keep them in line by means of ritual, the people will have a sense of shame and will moreover reform themselves.” 2.4 The Master said, “At age fifteen I set my heart upon learning; at thirty I took my stand; 13 at forty I became free of doubts; 14 at fifty I understood the Heavenly Mandate; 15 at sixty my ear was attuned; 16 and at seventy I could follow my heart’s desire without overstepping the bounds of propriety.” 2.7 Ziyou 17 asked about filial piety. The Master said, “Nowadays, ‘filial’ is used to refer to anyone who is merely able to provide their parents with nourishment. But even dogs and horses are provided with nourishment. If you do not treat your parents with reverence, wherein lies the difference?” 2.9 The Master said, “I can talk all day long with Yan Hui 18 without him once disagreeing with me or asking questions. In this way, he seems a bit dim-witted. And yet when he retires from my presence and I observe his behavior in private, I see that it is in fact worthy to serve as an illustration of what I have taught. Hui is not so stupid after all.” 12 Mao # 297. The original reference is to powerful war horses bred to pull chariots, who are trained not to swerve from the desired path. The metaphorical meaning is that one com- mitted through study to the Odes —“yoked” to them, as it were—will not be led astray. 13 That is, through mastery of the rites; cf. Analects 8.8, 16.13, and 20.3. 14 Cf. Analects 9.29. 15 Cf. Analects 16.8, 20.3. 16 Some interpretations take this to mean that Kongzi at this point immediately appre- hends the teachings he hears, others that there is no conflict between his inner dispositions and the teachings of the sages. The latter seems more plausible, as it more clearly links this stage with the stage that follows. 17 A disciple of Kongzi. 18 Kongzi’s favorite disciple, who tragically died at an early age (see Analects 5.9, 6.3, 6.7, 6.11, and 11.9).

6 ■ kongzi (confucius) 2.10 The Master said, “Pay attention to the means a man employs, observe the path he follows, and discover where it is he feels at home. 19 How can his character remain hidden? How can his character remain hidden?” 2.11 The Master said, “A true teacher is one who, keeping the past alive, is also able to understand the present.” 2.12 The Master said, “The gentleman does not serve as a vessel.” 20 2.15 The Master said, “To learn without si 8 , ‘thinking,’ will lead to confu- sion. To think without learning, however, will lead to fruitless exhaustion.” 21 2.21 Someone asked Kongzi, “Why is it that you are not participating in government?” 22 The Master answered, “We read in the History : Filial, oh so filial as a son, a friend to one’s brothers, both younger and elder; [in this way] exerting an influence upon the government. 23 Thus, in being a filial son and good brother one is already taking part in government. 24 What need is there, then, to speak of ‘participating in government’?” 25 19 Cf. Analects 4.2. 20 Qi 9 , literally a ritual vessel or implement designed to serve a particular function, is also used by extension to refer to officials who are specialized in one particular task. The gentleman is not a narrow specialist (cf. Analects 5.4, 6.13, 9.2, 9.6, 13.4 and 19.7). 21 Cf. Analects 15.31. 22 Wei zheng 3: (literally, “doing government”). The reference is to Kongzi’s lack of an official position. 23 Cf. James Legge, trans., The Chinese Classics, Volume III, The Shoo King , reprint (Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 1970), p. 535. 24 Cf. Analects 1.2. 25 The point is that one should be “doing government” through wuwei 23 , “not doing,”: that is, by perfecting oneself—as Youzi puts it in Analects 1.2, establishing the “root” of virtue—and letting the rest follow naturally.

The analects ■ 7

Book Three 3.1 Kongzi said of the head of the Ji clan, “He uses eight rows of dancers in his courtyard. 26 If this man can be tolerated, who cannot be tolerated?” 3.3 The Master said, “A man who is not ren —what has he to do with rit- ual? A man who is not ren —what has he to do with music?” 27 3.4 Lin Fang 28 asked about the roots of ritual practice. The Master exclaimed, “Noble indeed are you to ask such a question! When it comes to ritual, it is better to be frugal than extravagant. When it comes to mourning, it is better to be overwhelmed with grief than overly composed.” 3.8 Zixia 29 asked, “[The Odes say,] Her artful smile, with its alluring dimples, Her beautiful eyes, so clear, The unadorned upon which to paint. 30 What does this mean?” The Master said, “The task of applying colors comes only after a suit- able unadorned background is present.” Zixia said, “So it is the rites that come after?” 31 The Master said, “Zixia, you are truly one who can anticipate my thoughts! It is only with someone like you that I can begin to discuss the Odes .” 26 Later ritual texts describe this as a ritual prerogative of the emperor; presumably in Kongzi’s time it was viewed as a prerogative of the Zhou kings. 27 This comment is probably also directed at the head of the Ji clan criticized in Analects 3.1. Cf. Analects 3.12 and 17.11. 28 Lin Fang is usually identified as a man of Lu, and presumably shares Kongzi’s concern that his fellow citizens were neglecting the “roots” and attending to the superficial “branches” of ritual practice. 29 A disciple of Kongzi. 30 The first two lines appear in the present version of Odes ( Mao # 57), while the third does not. 31 That is, the adornment provided by the rites is meant to build upon appropriate na- tive emotions or tendencies. Just as all of the cosmetics in the world are of no avail if the basic lines of the face are not pleasing, so is the refinement provided by ritual practice of no help to one lacking in zhi < “native substance.” Cf. Analects 3.4, 5.10 and 6.18.

8 ■ kongzi (confucius) 3.11 Someone asked for an explanation of the di ; sacrifice. 32 The Mas- ter said, “I do not fully comprehend it. One who truly understood it could handle the world as if he had it right here,” and he pointed to the palm of his hand. 3.12 “Sacrifice as if [they were] present” means that, when sacrificing to the spirits, you should comport yourself as if the spirits were present. 33 The Master said, “If I am not fully present at the sacrifice, 34 it is as if I did not sacrifice at all.” 3.14 The Master said, “From the vantage point of the Zhou, one’s gaze can encompass the two dynasties that preceded it. 35 How brilliant in culture it was! I follow the Zhou.” 3.17 Zigong wanted to do away with the practice of sacrificing a lamb to announce the new moon. 36 The Master said, “Zigong! You regret the loss of the lamb, whereas I re- gret the loss of the rite.” 37 3.18 The Master said, “If in serving your ruler you are careful to observe every detail of ritual propriety, others will [wrongly] think you obsequious.” 38 32 An important sacrifice to the earliest known ancestor of the reigning dynasty, the per- formance of which was the prerogative of the presiding ruler. By Kongzi’s time, the perform- ance of this ceremony had degenerated to a point that he could no longer bear to look upon it. 33 That is, with an attitude of reverence and awe. There is no attribution for this line, and its form (cryptic text followed by an expanded, explanatory version) suggests that it might be a fragment from a lost ritual text interpolated by a later editor. Whether the Master’s words or not, it nonetheless clearly harmonizes with the comment from Kongzi that follows. 34 Although some commentators take “not being present” in the literal sense (i.e., not being physically present at the sacrifice, and sending a proxy in one’s stead), the preceding comment would suggest that what is at issue is psychological or spiritual presence. 35 That is, the Xia and Shang dynasties. 36 Apparently this sacrifice had originally been part of a larger ritual to welcome the new moon. By Kongzi’s time the ritual itself had fallen into disuse in Lu, whereas the sacrifice— being the responsibility of a particular government office—had survived. Zigong does not see the point of continuing this vestigial, materially wasteful practice in the absence of its original ritual context. 37 Continuing this vestigial practice is Kongzi’s way of mourning the loss of the original rite and keeping its memory alive, which in his view is worth the cost of an occasional lamb. 38 Ritual practice had so degenerated by Kongzi’s age that a proper ritual practitioner was viewed with suspicion or disdain.

The analects ■ 9 3.20 The Master said, “The ‘Cry of the Osprey’ 39 expresses joy without becoming licentious, and expresses sorrow without falling into excessive pathos.” 3.23 The Master was discussing music with the Grand Music Master of Lu. He said, “What can be known about music is this: when it first begins, it resounds with a confusing variety of notes, but as it unfolds, these notes are reconciled by means of harmony, brought into tension by means of coun- terpoint, and finally woven together into a seamless whole. It is in this way that music reaches its perfection.” 40 3.24 A border official of Yi requested an audience with the Master, saying, “I have never neglected to obtain an audience with the gentlemen who have passed this way.” Kongzi’s followers thus presented him. After emerging from the audience, the border official remarked to the gathered disciples, “You disciples, why should you be concerned about your Master’s loss of office? 41 It has been too long that the world has been with- out the Way, and Heaven intends to use your Master like the wooden clap- per in a bell.” 42 Book Four 4.1 The Master said, “With regard to neighborhoods, it is the presence of those who are ren that makes them desirable. Given a choice, then, how could someone who does not choose to dwell in ren be considered wise?” 4.2 The Master said, “Those who are not ren cannot remain constant in ad- versity and cannot enjoy enduring happiness. Those who are ren find their 39 The first of the Odes , and sometimes used to refer to the Odes as a whole. 40 Music thus serves as a model or metaphor for the process of self-cultivation: starting in confusion, passing through many phases and culminating in a state of wuwei perfection. 41 This loss of office is presumably the reason that Kongzi and his disciples are leaving the state. 42 That is, to wake up the fallen world. Some commentators believe that the bell referred to is the kind used by itinerant collectors and transmitters of folk songs, and that the bor- der official’s point is thus that Heaven has deliberately caused Kongzi to lose his official po- sition so that he might wander throughout the realm, spreading the teachings of the Way.

10 ■ kongzi (confucius) repose in ren ; those who are wise follow ren because they know that they will li = , ‘profit,’ from it.” 4.4 The Master said, “Having merely set your heart sincerely upon ren, you can be sure of remaining free of odium.” 4.5 The Master said, “Wealth and honor are things that all people desire, and yet unless they are acquired in the proper way I will not abide them. Poverty and disgrace are things that all people hate, and yet unless they are avoided in the proper way I will not despise them. “If the gentleman abandons ren , how can he be worthy of that name? The gentleman does not violate ren even for the amount of time required to eat a meal. Even in times of urgency or distress, he does not depart from it.” 4.6 The Master said, “I have yet to meet a person who truly loved ren or hated a lack of ren . One who loved ren could not be surpassed, while one who hated a lack of ren would at least be able to act in a ren fashion, insofar as he would not tolerate that which is not ren being associated with his person. “Is there a person who can, for the space of a single day, simply devote his efforts to ren ? I have never seen one whose strength is insufficient for this task. Perhaps such a person exists, but I have yet to meet him.” 43 4.7 The Master said, “People are true to type with regard to that which they overlook. Observe closely what a person overlooks—then you will know whether or not he is ren .” 44 4.8 The Master said, “Having in the morning learned the Way, one could die that evening without regret.” 4.9 The Master said, “A true shi > , ‘scholar,’ is one who has set his heart upon the Way. A fellow who is ashamed merely of shabby clothing or mea- ger rations is not even worth conversing with.” 4.10 The Master said, “Acting in the world, the gentleman has no predis- positions for or against anything. He merely seeks to be on the side of what is yi ? , ‘right.’” 43 Cf. Analects 7.30. 44 That is, it is often in unpremeditated, unconscious actions that one’s true character is revealed.

The analects ■ 11 4.12 The Master said, “If your conduct is determined solely by considera- tions of profit you will arouse great resentment.” 4.13 The Master said, “If a person is able to govern the state by means of ritual propriety and deference, what difficulties will he encounter? If, on the other hand, a person is not able to govern the state through ritual pro- priety and deference, of what use are the rites to him?” 45 4.14 The Master said, “Do not be concerned that you lack an official po- sition, but rather concern yourself with the means by which you might take your stand. Do not be concerned that no one has heard of you, but rather strive to become a person worthy of being known.” 4.15 The Master said, “Zengzi! All that I teach 46 is unified by one guiding principle.” Zengzi answered, “Yes.” After the Master left, the other disciples asked, “What did he mean by that?” Zengzi said, “All of what the Master teaches amounts to nothing more than zhong @ , ‘loyalty,’ tempered by shu A , ‘sympathetic understanding.’” 47 4.16 The Master said, “The gentleman understands what is right, whereas the petty man understands profit.” 4.17 The Master said, “When you see someone who is xian B , ‘worthy,’ concentrate upon becoming their equal; when you see someone who is un- worthy, use this as an opportunity to look within yourself.” 45 Cf. Analects 13.5. 46 The word rendered here as “teach” ( dao / ) also means “the Way,” and a double enten- dre is almost certainly intended: “all that I teach” is also “my Way.” 47 To be zhong “loyal” or “dutiful” involves fulfilling the duties and obligations proper to one’s ritually defined role (see Analects 5.19 below for a description of someone deemed zhong by Kongzi). This virtue is to be tempered by the virtue of shu “sympathetic under- standing”: the ability, by means of imaginatively putting oneself in the place of another, to know when it is appropriate or yi, “right,” to bend or suspend the dictates of role-specific duty. Cf. Analects 5.12, 6.30, 12.2 and 15.24.

12 ■ kongzi (confucius) 4.18 The Master said, “In serving your parents you may gently remonstrate with them. However, once it becomes apparent that they have not taken your criticism to heart you should be respectful and not oppose them, and follow their lead diligently without resentment.” 4.19 The Master said, “When your parents are alive, you should not travel far, and when you do travel you must keep to a fixed itinerary.” 48 4.20 The Master said, “One who makes no changes to the ways of his father for three years 49 after his father has passed away may be called a filial son.” 4.21 The Master said, “You must always be aware of your parents’ age. On the one hand, it is a cause for rejoicing, on the other, a source of anxiety.” 50 4.22 The Master said, “People in ancient times did not speak lightly, and were ashamed lest their actions not measure up to their words.” 51 4.23 The Master said, “Very few go astray who comport themselves with restraint.” 4.24 The Master said, “The gentleman wishes to be slow of speech and cau- tious with regard to his actions.” 4.25 The Master said, “Virtue is never alone; it always has neighbors.” 52 Book Five 5.1 The Master said of Gong Yechang, “He is marriageable. Although he was once imprisoned and branded as a criminal, he was in fact innocent of any crime.” The Master gave him his daughter in marriage. 53 48 So as not to give your parents undue cause for worry. 49 The length of the mourning period for parents, equivalent to 25 months by Western reckoning. Cf. Analects 17.21 and the note to that passage. 50 The age of one’s parents is a cause for rejoicing in that they have lived so long, while also a source of anxiety because of their advancing years. 51 Cf. Analects 14.27. 52 The reference is to the attractive power of Virtue. 53 The social stigma attached to former criminals in early China was enormous and in- escapable, since criminals were prominently branded or tattooed. In giving his daughter in

The Master said, “In a state that can field one thousand chariots, Zilu could be employed to organize the collection of military taxes, but I do not know whether or not he is ren .” “What about Ranyou?” “In a town of one thousand households, or an aristocratic family that can field one hundred chariots, Ranyou could be employed as a steward, but I do not know whether or not he is ren .” “What about Zihua?” “With his sash tied, standing in his proper place at court, Zihua could be employed to converse with guests and visitors, but I do not know whether or not he is ren .” 5.9 The Master said to Zigong, “How would you compare yourself with Yan Hui?” Zigong answered, “How dare I even think of comparing myself with Hui? When Hui learns one thing, it allows him to immediately grasp ten. When I learn one thing, I am able to grasp two.” The Master said, “No, you are not the equal of Hui. You or I—neither of us is the equal of Hui.” marriage to a former criminal, Kongzi is flouting conventional mores and making a powerful statement concerning the independence of true morality from conventional social judgements. 54 Cf. Analects 2.12 and see the note to that passage. 55 The son of a minister of Lu, who also appears in Analects 2.6 (not included in this vol- ume). The three figures he asks about—Zilu, Ranyou, and Zihua—are all disciples of Kongzi.

14 ■ kongzi (confucius) 5.10 Zaiyu 56 was in the habit of sleeping during the daytime. The Master said, “Rotten wood cannot be carved, and a wall of dung cannot be beau- tified. As for Zaiyu, what would be the use of reprimanding him?” 57 The Master added, “At first, when evaluating people, I would listen to their words and then simply trust that the corresponding conduct would follow. Now when I evaluate people I listen to their words but then closely observe their conduct. It is my experience with Zaiyu that has motivated this change.” 5.12 Zigong said, “What I do not wish others to do unto me, I also wish not to do unto others.” The Master said, “Ah, Zigong! That is something quite beyond you.” 58 5.13 Zigong said, “The Master’s cultural brilliance is something that is readily heard about, whereas one does not get to hear the Master ex- pounding upon the subjects of xing C ‘human nature’ or tiandao $/ , ‘the Way of Heaven.’” 59 5.19 Zizhang 60 said, “Prime Minister Ziwen 61 was rewarded three times with the post of prime minister, and yet he never showed a sign of pleas- ure; he was removed from this office three times, and yet never showed a 56 A disciple of Kongzi. 57 That is, Zaiyu obviously lacks the zhi < , “native substance” (see Analects 6.18), that serves as the background upon which the “color” of Confucian self-cultivation is to be ap- plied (see Analects 3.8). 58 Zigong’s aspiration—what has been referred to as the “negative Golden Rule”—is a formulation of the virtue of shu, “sympathetic understanding”: the ability to temper the strict dictates of loyalty to one’s zhong, “duty” by imaginatively placing oneself in another’s place. See Analects 4.15. Zigong’s aspiration to the virtue of shu is particularly amusing to Kongzi because Zigong is the most unimaginative and rigid of all the disciples. In Analects 5.4, for instance, his fastidious adherence to the rites leads Confucius to dub him a “ritual vessel” of limited capacity, and in Analects 14.29 he is criticized by Confucius for being too strict and judgmental with others (i.e., for not moderating his duty-defined demands upon others with understanding). Zigong thus functions in the Analects as an excellent example of how the virtue of loyalty goes awry when not tempered with sympathetic understanding, and this is perhaps why Kongzi singles out Zigong in Analects 15.24 for his message that “sympathetic understanding” is the one teaching that can serve as a life-long guide. 59 That is, in his teachings Kongzi did not concern himself much with such theoretical, esoteric subjects as human nature or the Way of Heaven, but rather tried to focus his disci- ples’ attention upon the task at hand, acquiring the cultural refinement necessary to become gentlemen. 60 A disciple of Kongzi. 61 A prime minister of the state of Chu who was reknowned for his integrity and devo- tion to the state.

What do you make of Prime Minister Ziwen?” The Master said, “He certainly was zhong, ‘loyal.’” “Could he not also be said to have been ren ?” “I do not know about that—what makes you think he deserves to be called ren ?” “When Cuizi assassinated the Lord of Qi, Chen Wenzi—whose estate could field ten chariots—abandoned all that he possessed and left the state. 62 Upon reaching another state, he said, ‘The officials here are as bad as our Great Officer Cuizi,’ and thereupon left that state. Again, after going to another state, he said, ‘The officials here are as bad as our Great Officer Cuizi,’ and thereupon left that state as well. What do you make of Chen Wenzi?” The Master said, “He certainly was pure.” “Could he not also be said to have been ren ?” “I do not know about that—what makes you think he deserves to be called ren ?” 5.22 When the Master was in the state of Chen, he sighed, “Oh, let us go home! Let us go home! Our young followers back in Lu are wild and am- bitious—they put on a great show of brilliant culture, but they lack the means to prune and shape it.” 63 5.26 Yan Hui and Zilu were in attendance. The Master said to them, “Why don’t each of you speak to me of your aspirations?” Zilu said, “I would like to be able to share my carts and horses, clothing and fur with my friends, and not become resentful if they are returned damaged.” Yan Hui said, “I would like to avoid being boastful about my own abil- ities or exaggerating my accomplishments.” Zilu said, “I would like to hear of the Master’s aspirations.” The Master said, “To bring contentment to the aged, to have trust in my friends, and to cherish the young.” 64 62 Cuizi and Chen Wenzi were both officials in the state of Qi. The former is said to have assassinated Lord Zhuang of Qi in 548 B . C . E . 63 Cf. Mengzi 7B37. 64 Cf. the more elaborate version of a similar conversation in Analects 11.26.

16 ■ kongzi (confucius) 5.27 The Master said, “I should just give up! I have yet to meet the man who is able to perceive his own faults and then take himself to task inwardly.” 5.28 The Master said, “In any town of ten households you will be certain to find someone who is as zhong @ , ‘loyal,’ or xin D , ‘trustworthy,’ as I am, but you will not find anyone who matches my love for learning.” Book Six 6.3 Duke Ai 65 asked, “Who among your disciples might be said to love learning?” Kongzi answered, “There was one named Yan Hui who loved learning. He never misdirected his anger, and never repeated a mistake twice. Un- fortunately he was fated to live a short life, and has since passed away.” 6.5 Yuan Si was appointed as steward. He was allocated a salary of nine hundred bushels of grain, which he declined. The Master said, “Do not de- cline it! [If you do not need it yourself], could you not use it to aid the households in your neighborhood?” 66 6.7 The Master said, “Ah, Yan Hui! For three months at a time his heart did not stray from ren . The rest of them could only achieve such a state by fits and starts.” 6.10 Bo-niu 67 fell ill, and the Master went to ask after his health. Grasping his hand through the window, the Master sighed, “That we are going to lose him must be due to ming, ‘ fate!’ How else could such a man be afflicted with such an illness? How else could such a man be afflicted with such an illness?” 65 Duke Ai (r. 494–468 B . C . E .) was the nominal ruler of Lu, which was in fact controlled by the Ji family. 66 In light of the many injunctions against seeking office for the sake of material benefit found in Kongzi’s teachings, the disciple Yuan Si no doubt expected to be praised by the Master for declining to be paid a salary. Kongzi’s response reflects the fact that the proper course of action cannot be determined by a simple formula, but should rather be the result of careful reflection and consideration of the needs of others. The Master may also have de- tected a note of spiritual pride in Yuan Si’s grandiose gesture and seen the need to deflate his feeling of self-importance. 67 A disciple of Kongzi.

The analects ■ 17 6.11 The Master said, “What a worthy man was Yan Hui! Living in a nar- row alley, subsisting upon meager bits of rice and water—other people could not have borne such hardship, and yet it never spoiled Hui’s joy. What a worthy man was Hui!” 6.12 Ranyou said, “It is not that I do not delight in the Master’s Way, it is simply that my strength is insufficient.” The Master said, “Those for whom it is genuinely a problem of insuffi- cient strength end up collapsing somewhere along the Way. As for you, you deliberately draw the line.” 68 6.13 The Master said to Zixia, “You must become a gentlemanly ru , not a petty ru .” 69 6.17 The Master said, “Who is able to leave a room without going out through the door? How is it, then, that none of you follow this Way?” 6.18 The Master said, “When zhi < , ‘native substance,’ overwhelms wen 4 , ‘cultural refinement,’ the result is a crude rustic. When cultural refine- ment overwhelms native substance, the result is a foppish pedant. Only when culture and native substance are perfectly mixed and balanced do you have a gentleman.” 6.20 The Master said, “One who knows it 70 is not the equal of one who loves it, and one who loves it is not the equal of one who takes joy in it.” 6.22 Fan Chi 71 asked about wisdom. The Master said, “Devoting yourself to transforming the values of the common people, to serving the ghosts and spirits with reverence and yet keeping them at a distance—this might be called wisdom.” 68 That is, Ranyou has already decided he cannot do it, and so does not even really try. For a discussion of this passage and its relationship to the problem of “weakness of will,” refer to Nivison (1998), pp. 80–82. 69 The term “petty ru ” refers to someone content to serve as a narrow technician or “ves- sel” ( Analects 2.12) or to a moral hypocrite such as the “village worthy” ( Analects 17.13). See also ru under Important Terms . 70 That is, the Way. 71 One of Kongzi’s younger disciples.

18 ■ kongzi (confucius) He then asked about ren . The Master said, “One who is ren sees as his first priority the hardship of self-cultivation, and does not think about attaining any results or re- wards. Yes, this is what we might call ren .” 6.23 The Master said, “One who is wise takes joy in the rivers, while one who is ren takes joy in the mountains. The wise are active, while the ren are still. The wise are joyful, while the ren are long-lived.” 72 6.25 The Master said, “A gu G that is not a gu —is it really a gu ? Is it re- ally a gu ?” 73 6.27 The Master said, “A gentleman who is broadly learned with regard to culture and whose comportment has been disciplined by the rites can, I think, rely upon this training and so avoid straying from the Way.” 6.28 The Master had an audience with Nanzi, and Zilu was not pleased. 74 The Master swore an oath in Zilu’s presence, saying, “If I have done any- thing contrary to the Way, may Heaven reject me! May Heaven reject me!” 72 This is a famously cryptic passage. Perhaps the most plausible interpretation is pro- vided by the Han dynasty commentator Bao Xian EF : “The wise take joy in actively ex- ercising their talent and wisdom in governing the world, just as water flows on and on and knows no cease. The ren take joy in the sort of peace and stability displayed by mountains, which are naturally nonactive and yet give birth to all of the myriad things.” 73 A gu was a ritual drinking vessel, and commentators generally agree that Kongzi’s sigh of displeasure was provoked by the fact that the sort of gu being used by his contemporaries was not a proper gu (i.e., not in accordance with Zhou dynasty standards), although there is disagreement over the question of what precisely was wrong—some claiming that the of- fending gu was not of the proper shape, others that it was not of the proper size. In any case, this passage serves to illustrate Kongzi’s strict adherence to ancient practices, his dissatisfac- tion with the practices of his contemporaries, and his concern for the proper use of names (cf. Analects 13.3). For an image of a gu , see the web page for this volume. 74 Nanzi was the wife of Lord Ling of Wei, and a woman of bad repute. Zilu is not pleased that Kongzi would seek an audience with such a person. As many commentators point out, however, it is likely that ritual dictated that when arriving in a state one request an audience with certain minor local officials. In having an audience with Nanzi upon ar- riving in Wei, Kongzi was therefore merely observing the dictates of ritual propriety, which is more important than avoiding unsavory company. Zilu might thus—like Chen Wenzi in Analects 5.19 above—be characterized as “pure,” but such rigid fastidiousness falls rather short of ren .

The analects ■ 19 6.29 The Master said, “Acquiring virtue through use of zhong H , ‘the mean’—is this not best? And yet for some time now such virtue has been quite hard to find among the people.” 6.30 Zigong said, “If there were one able to universally extend his benevo- lence to the people and bring succor to the multitudes, what would you make of him? Could such a person be called ren ?” The Master said, “Why stop at ren ? Such a person should surely be called a sage! Even someone like Yao or Shun would find such a task daunting. “Desiring to take his stand, one who is ren helps others to take their stand; wanting to realize himself, he helps others to realize themselves. Being able to take what is near at hand as an example 75 could perhaps be called the method of ren .” Book Seven 7.1 The Master said, “I transmit rather than innovate. I trust in and have a love for antiquity. I might thus humbly compare myself to Old Peng.” 76 7.2 The Master said, “Remaining silent and yet comprehending, constantly learning and yet never becoming tired, encouraging others and never grow- ing weary—these are tasks that present me with no difficulty.” 7.3 The Master said, “That I fail to cultivate my Virtue, that I fail to delve more deeply into that which I have learned, that upon hearing what is right I remain unable to move in that direction, and that I prove unable to reform my faults—such [potential] failings are a source of constant concern to me.” 7.4 In his leisure moments, the Master was proper and serious and yet fully at ease. 75 This sounds like a formulation of the virtue of shu, “sympathetic understanding.” See Analects 4.15. 76 There is a great deal of commentarial controversy concerning the meaning of this ref- erence but the most plausible explanation is that of Bao Xian, who takes the reference to be to one person: “Old Peng was a great worthy of the Yin dynasty who was fond of transmit- ting ancient tales. In comparing himself to Old Peng, Kongzi indicates his reverence for those who merely transmit [and do not innovate].”
