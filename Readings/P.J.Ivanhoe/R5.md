## Mengzi (Mencius) 

**Introduction** 

Mengzi i! was a Chinese Confucian philosopher who lived in the fourth century B . C . E . He was born after Kongzi died, so he never studied under Kongzi, or even met him. However, Mengzi tried to teach, practice, and defend the Way of Kongzi as he understood it. Although he is not nearly as well known in the West as Kongzi, Mengzi has long been regarded in China (and throughout East Asia) as second only to Kongzi himself in im- portance as a Confucian thinker. The collection of Mengzi’s sayings, dialogues, and debates with others is known simply as the Mengzi (or, following the Jesuit Latinization of his name, the Mencius ). It is divided into seven “books,” each of which is sub- divided into two parts (called the “A” and “B” parts), which are then fur- ther divided into “chapters.” So, for example, Mengzi 1B3 is book 1, second part, chapter 3. Mengzi saw the main intellectual opponents of the Way of Kongzi as being the teachings of Yang Zhu and Mozi (3B9, 7A26). Mozi, as we saw in Chapter Two, advocated a kind of universalistic consequentialism. There are few, if any, texts that have survived to the present day that we can con- fidently identify as presenting the teachings of Yang Zhu, so we do not know exactly what his philosophy was. However, it seems clear that Yang Zhu emphasized following one’s xing C , “nature” (see Important Terms ), and claimed that the teachings of both Mohism and Confucianism ask us to act contrary to our natures by making what Yang Zhu saw as excessive sacrifices for others. On this basis, Mengzi accused Yang Zhu (perhaps un- fairly) of being a sort of extreme egoist.

Mengzi agrees with Yang Zhu that humans have a nature, which they should follow. Indeed, he criticizes a rival philosopher, Gaozi, for suggest- ing that ethical cultivation must involve violating one’s nature ( Mengzi 6A1). However, Mengzi argues against Yang Zhu that there are incipient virtuous inclinations in one’s nature ( Mengzi 6A6). He frequently describes these inclinations using a metaphor of “sprouts,” and compares ethical cul- tivation to tending these sprouts ( Mengzi 2A6, 2A2, 6A7–8). Mengzi pres- ents various kinds of evidence for the existence of ethical “sprouts” in humans, including the “giveaway” actions of adults who spontaneously manifest these inclinations (such as King Xuan, whose sympathy for an ox being led to slaughter shows his nascent compassion [ Mengzi 1A7]), and “thought experiments” (such as asking us what our intuitions are about how a normal human would react to the sight of a child about to fall into a well [ Mengzi 2A6], or to the sight of the corpses of loved ones rotting by the roadside [ Mengzi 3A5]). It is important to understand that, although the presence of the sprouts guarantees the goodness of human nature , this does not entail that most hu- mans are actually good. Mengzi stresses that a bad environment (and fail- ure to cultivate oneself) can almost destroy one’s original nature ( Mengzi 6A8). Furthermore, our compassion for others and disdain to do what is wrong are innate, but only incipient. Thus the task of moral cultivation is to “extend” or “fill out” the reactions from the paradigmatic cases where we already have them to the relevantly similar cases where we do not yet have them, but ought to ( Mengzi 7A15, 7A17, 7B31). Mengzi thinks that most people will be unable to develop their nature without having their basic needs for things such as food met ( Mengzi 7A27). Indeed, Mengzi provides specific advice about proper farm man- agement ( Mengzi 3A3), showing his concern with the practicalities of governing. Once their fundamental needs are met, basic—but universal— ethical education is crucial ( Mengzi 1A7, 3A4). However, Mengzi recog- nizes that, while everyone has the capacity to become a sage, not everyone will realize that ability. Advanced ethical cultivation requires education under a wise teacher. Mengzi’s students pose him questions, often involving conundrums from two works that were already quite old and almost canonical by Mengzi’s time: the History and the Odes ( Mengzi 5A2, 7B3, see also Important Texts ). It is significant that much of Mengzi’s teaching is based on concrete cases, rather than abstract principles. Although he clearly thinks that there is a best Way to live, and a best choice in every situation ( Mengzi 4B29), his approach is “particularistic” in emphasizing the context-sensitivity of virtue ( Mengzi 4A17). Thus, he tries to cultivate in his students a skill that goes beyond any simple tool or technique ( Mengzi 7B5). This is perhaps part of his reason for suggesting that you should “seek for in your heart” what “you do not get from doctrines” ( Mengzi 2A2). Mengzi uses his particular conception of human nature to provide a re- sponse to both Mohism and Yangism. As we have seen, Mengzi agrees with the Yangists that humans have a nature that they should follow, but argues that the Yangists have supplied an impoverished account of the contents of that nature. Against the Mohists, Mengzi argues that there is a natural order of development of human compassion, and that, as a matter of psy- chological fact, humans must learn to love members of their own family be- fore they can learn to love strangers ( Mengzi 7A15, 7A45). Some Mohists in Mengzi’s era seem to have conceded this point, but argued that the feel- ing of compassion cultivated in the family should be extended outward to love everyone equally. However, Mengzi claims that, given the way in which our compassion develops out of love of kin, any effort to love every- one equally violates our naturally greater compassion for family members ( Mengzi 3A5). Finally, Mengzi argues that the effort to base one’s actions on li = , “benefit” or “profit,” even if it is the profit of one’s kingdom as a whole, will be self-defeating ( Mengzi 1A1). 



**Book One** 

1A1 Mengzi had an audience with King Hui of Liang. The King said, “Sir, you have come, not regarding one thousand li as too far. Surely you will have something to profit my state?” Mengzi said in response, “Why must Your Majesty say, ‘profit’? Let there be benevolence and righteousness and that is all. Your Majesty says, ‘How can my state be profited?’ The Counsellors say, ‘How can my family be profited?’ The scholars and commoners say, ‘How can I be profited?’ Those above and those below mutually compete for profit and the state is endangered. “In a case where the ruler of a state that can field ten thousand chariots is murdered, it must be by a family that can field a thousand chariots. In a case where the ruler of a state that can field a thousand chariots is mur- dered, it must be by a family that can field a hundred chariots. One thou- sand out of ten thousand, or one hundred out of a thousand, cannot be considered to not be a lot. But if righteousness is put behind and profit is put ahead, one will not be satisfied without grasping from others.

114 ■ Mengzi (Mencius) “There have never been those who were benevolent who abandoned their parents. There have never been those who were righteous who put their ruler last. Let Your Majesty say, ‘Benevolence and righteousness,’ and that is all. Why must you say ‘profit’?” 1A3 King Hui of Liang said, “In relation to the state, We exert our heart to the utmost. When there is a famine in the region inside the river, then We move people to the region east of the river, and move grain to the re- gion inside the river. When there is a famine in the region east of the river, We do the converse. When We examine the government of neighboring states, there is none that exerts itself as We do. Yet the people of neighbor- ing states do not grow fewer, and Our people do not grow more numerous. How is this?” Mengzi responded, “Your Majesty is fond of war. Allow me to use an il- lustration from warfare: Thunderingly, the drums beat the soldiers forward; their swords have already clashed; casting aside their armor and trailing their weapons they run away. Some run a hundred paces and then stop; others run fifty paces and then stop. How would it be if those who ran fifty paces laughed at those who ran a hundred paces?” He responded, “That is unacceptable. They simply did not run a hun- dred paces. But what they did is running away too.” Mengzi said, “If Your Majesty understands this, then you will not expect your people to be more numerous than those of neighboring states.” . . . 1A7 King Xuan of Qi asked, “May I hear from you of the actions of the Lord Protectors Huan of Qi and Wen of Jin?” Mengzi said in response, “The disciples of Zhongni (i.e., Kongzi) did not give accounts of the actions of Huan and Wen. Because of this, they were not passed on to later generations, and I, your servant, have not heard of them. 1 But, if you insist, then may we talk about being a genuine king?” 2 Xuan said, “What must one’s Virtue be like so that one can become a king?” Mengzi said, “One cares for the people and becomes a king. This is something no one can stop.” Xuan said, “Can one such as I care for the people?” 1 Mengzi is not being truthful here. In Mengzi 4B21 (not in this volume) Mengzi says there are historical records of Huan and Wen. See Mengzi 4B11 on honesty. 2 Xuan is a king in name only. See Important Terms .

Mengzi said, “He can.” Xuan said, “How do you know that I can?” Mengzi said, “I heard your attendant Hu He say, The King was sitting up in his hall. 3 There was an ox being led past below. The King saw it and said, “Where is the ox going?” Someone responded, “We are about to consecrate a bell with its blood.” The King said, “Spare it. I cannot bear its frightened appearance, like an innocent going to the execution ground.” Someone responded, “So should we abandon the consecrating of the bell?” The King said, “How can that be abandoned? Ex- change it for a sheep.” Mengzi continued, “I do not know if this happened.” Xuan said, “It happened.” Mengzi said, “This feeling is sufficient to be a king. 4 The commoners all thought Your Majesty was being stingy. But I knew that Your Majesty could not bear the frightened appearance of the ox.” The King said, “That is so. There really were commoners like that. Al- though Qi is a small state, how could I be stingy about one ox? It was just that I could not bear its frightened appearance, like an innocent going to the execution ground. Hence, I exchanged it for a sheep.” Mengzi said, “Let Your Majesty not be surprised at the commoners’ tak- ing you to be stingy. You took a small thing and exchanged it for a big thing. How could they understand? If Your Majesty were pained at its being innocent and going to the execution ground, then what is there to choose between an ox and a sheep?” The King laughed, saying, “What was this feeling really?! It’s not the case that I grudged its value and exchanged it for a sheep. But it makes sense that the commoners would say I was stingy.” Mengzi said, “There is no harm. This is just the way benevolence works. You saw the ox but had not seen the sheep. As for the relation of gentle- men to birds and beasts, if they see them living, they cannot bear to see 3 Since ancient times in China, royal palaces have included halls raised above the ground, often looking out onto the courtyard below. See the web site for this volume for an image of such a hall. Cf. Zhuangzi , chapter 13, p. 237. 4 “Feeling” k , here and below, is literally “heart” ( xin ), see Important Terms .

Hence, gentlemen keep their distance from the kitchen.” The King was pleased and said, “The Odes say, Another person had the heart, But I measured it. 5 This describes you. I was the one who did it. I reflected and sought it out, but did not understand my heart. You spoke, and in my heart there was a feeling of compassion. In what way does this heart accord with being a king?” Mengzi said, “Suppose there were someone who reported to your majesty, saying, ‘My strength is sufficient to lift five hundred pounds, but not sufficient to lift one feather. My eyesight is sufficient to examine the tip of an autumn hair, 6 but I cannot see a wagon of firewood.’ Would Your Majesty accept that?” Xuan said, “No.” Mengzi said, “In the present case your kindness is sufficient to reach birds and beasts, but the benefits do not reach the commoners. Why is this case alone different? Hence, not lifting one feather is due to not using one’s strength. Not seeing a wagon of firewood is due to not using one’s eyesight. The commoners not receiving care is due to not using one’s kindness. Hence, Your Majesty’s not being a genuine king is due to not acting; it is not due to not being able.” Xuan said, “What is the difference between concrete cases of not doing and not being able?” Mengzi said, “ ‘Pick up Mount Tai and leap over the North Sea.’ If you say, ‘I cannot,’ this is truly not being able. ‘Massage the stiff joints of an eld- erly person.’ If you say, ‘I cannot,’ this is not acting; it is not a case of not being able. So Your Majesty’s not being a king is not in the category of pick- ing up Mount Tai and leaping over the North Sea. Your Majesty’s not being a king is in the category of massaging the stiff joints of an elderly person. ”Treat your elders as elders, and extend it to the elders of others; treat your young ones as young ones, 7 and extend it to the young ones of others; then you can turn the whole world in the palm of your hand. The Odes say, 5 Mao # 198. 6 An animal’s hair is most fine (and hence thin) during the autumn. 7 That is, “Treat your elders and young ones as elders and young ones should be treated.”

He set an example for his wife, It extended to his brothers, And so he controlled his family and state. 8 This means that he simply took this feeling and applied it to that. Hence, if one extends one’s kindness, it will be sufficient to care for all within the Four Seas. If one does not extend one’s kindness, one will lack the wherewithal to care for one’s wife and children. That in which the ancients greatly exceeded others was no other than this. They were simply good at extending what they did. In the present case your kindness is sufficient to reach birds and beasts, but the benefits do not reach the commoners. Why is this case alone differ- ent? Weigh, and then you will distinguish the light and the heavy. Measure, and then you will distinguish the long and the short. Things are all like this, the heart most of all. Let Your Majesty measure it. “Perhaps Your Majesty can only be happy in his heart by rallying sol- diers, endangering his scholars and ministers, and incurring the resentment of the other lords?” Xuan said, “No. How could I be happy about these things?” Mengzi said, “Could I hear Your Majesty’s greatest desire?” The King smiled and did not speak. Mengzi said, “Is it because your hearty and sweet foods are insufficient for your mouth? Are your light and warm clothes insufficient for your body? Or yet because the beautiful and charming sights are insufficient for your eyes to look at? The melodies are insufficient for your ears to listen to? The servants are insufficient to order about in front of you? Your Majesty’s various ministers are sufficient to serve you. Does Your Majesty actually do what you do for these things?!” Xuan said, “No. It is not for the sake of these things.” Mengzi said, “Then Your Majesty’s greatest desire can be known. You desire to govern the land, bring to your court the states of Qin and Chu, oversee the Central Kingdom, and dominate the barbarians. By means of such things as you do, to seek such things as you desire, is like climbing a tree in search of a fish.” The King said, “Is it as extreme as that?” Mengzi said, “The danger is greater than that! If one climbs a tree in search of a fish, although one will not get a fish, there will not be any dis- aster afterward. By means of such things as you do, to seek such things as 8 Mao # 240.
