## Mozi 

### Introduction 

Mozi  , “Master Mo,” (c. 480–390 B . C . E .) founded what came to be known as the Mojia “Mohist School” of philosophy and is the figure around whom the text known as the Mozi was formed. His proper name is Mo Di . Mozi is arguably the first true philosopher of China known to us. He developed systematic analyses and criticisms of his opponents’ posi- tions and presented an array of arguments in support of his own philo- sophical views. His interest and faith in argumentation led him and his later followers to study the forms and methods of philosophical debate, and their work contributed significantly to the development of early Chinese philosophy. Mozi himself was probably of quite humble origins. He may have been a member of the craft or artisan class, and his philosophy is dis- tinctively antiaristocratic. Early in life, he may have studied with followers of Confucius. However, he went on to become a serious critic of the emerg- ing Confucian tradition. 1 Mozi was not just a philosopher. He led an organized utopian movement whose members engaged in direct social action, including the military de- fense of states and cities that he judged to be victims of wars of expansion. He was a strong and charismatic leader who inspired his followers to dedicate themselves to his unique view of social justice. This required them to lead austere and quite demanding lives under his direct control and command. Mozi could tax his followers, judge, and punish them; under certain circumstances he could even put them to death. 

- > 1 During Kongzi’s life and after his death, people began to declare themselves followers of Kongzi and his Way. At this point, it makes sense to describe these people as constitut- ing a “Confucian” tradition or “Confucianism.”

The discipline that defined his movement is reflected in a number of his philosophical positions. His ideal state is highly centralized, orderly, and ideologically unified. Mozi saw ideological differences and the factionalism they spawned as the primary source of human suffering. Therefore, he sharply criticized the family-based ethical and political system of Kongzi for its inherent partial- ity and advocated a strict chain of command leading up through a monarch and resting in Heaven. In place of Confucian ren 1 “benevolence” he ad- vocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state. As an alterna- tive to Confucian familial love, he argued for jian’ai ^_ , which is often translated as “universal love” but is better understood as “impartial care.” In Mozi’s view, the central ethical problem was excessive partiality , not a lack of compassion . His primary goal was to change and shape behavior— in particular the way people are treated—not to cultivate emotions, atti- tudes, or virtues. He showed little interest in what one would call moral psychology and embraced a simple and highly malleable view of human na- ture. This led him away from the widely observed Chinese concern with self-cultivation. His general lack of appreciation for psychological goods and the need to control desires and shape dispositions and attitudes also led him to reject categorically the characteristic Confucian concern with cul- ture and ritual. These views are expressed in his arguments against elabo- rate funerals and musical performances, two mainstays of Confucianism. While Mozi was not a self-cultivationist, he believed that human beings can change even apparently deeply held attitudes and dispositions quickly and easily. For a variety of reasons, he maintained that people could be in- duced to take up almost any form of behavior, even behavior that was sui- cidal. He shared a commonly held early Chinese belief in a psychological tendency to respond in kind to the treatment one receives. He further be- lieved that in an effort to win the favor of their rulers, many people are in- clined to act as their rulers desire. Those who do not respond to either of these influences can be motivated and controlled by a system of strict re- wards and punishments, enforced by the state and guaranteed by the sup- port of Heaven, ghosts, and spirits. Most important of all, Mozi believed that properly crafted rational arguments provide strong if not entirely com- pelling motivation to act for anyone who is able to understand them; pre- sented with a superior argument, thinking people act accordingly. Mozi’s later followers lasted until the time of the short-lived Qin dynasty when the movement seems to have suddenly come to an end.

The reasons for this are not well documented, but most likely a paramilitary group such as the Mohists would never have been tolerated by and could not survive during the centralized and militarized regime of the Qin. There is some irony in this as several prominent ideas in the Fajia “Legalist” thought that served as the state ideology of the Qin find clear precedents in Mozi’s phi- losophy. The later Mohists continued Mozi’s early interests and developed sophisticated systems of logical analysis, mathematics, optics, physics, de- fensive warfare technology and strategy, and a formal ethic based upon cal- culations of benefit and harm. All of these philosophical concerns can be found in the early strata of the Mozi that are represented in the following selections. 



##Chapter Eight: Honoring the Worthy

Our teacher Mozi 3 says, “The kings, dukes, and great officials who now rule the various states all want their states to be wealthy, their populations great, and their administrations orderly, and yet instead of wealth they get poverty, instead of great populations they get meager ones, and instead of order they get chaos. In this way they fundamentally miss what they desire and get what they dislike.” What is the reason for this? 4 Our teacher Mozi says, “This is because the kings, dukes, and great of- ficials who rule the various states are not able to honor the worthy and em- ploy the capable in carrying out their rule. And so in a state where there are many worthy men, good order will be secure, and in a state where there are few worthy men good order will be tenuous.

> - 2 There are multiple versions of many of the central chapters of the Mozi; these probably reflect the views of the three different sects of Mohism, which appeared after Mozi’s death. I have chosen what I consider to be the most interesting version of each chapter translated here. Our chapter headings refer to the primary divisions in standard editions of the com- plete text. 3 The Mozi is unique among early Chinese philosophical texts in the manner in which it refers to its author. Most philosophers of the period were referred to as “Master so-and-so” by adding the honorific zi ! after the person’s surname (see Important Terms ). In the case of Mo Di \] this would yield “Mozi.” But the Mohists refer to their master as zimozi !\! . This probably meant “Our teacher Master Mo.” A similar prefixed use of zi is found in the Gongyang commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals . 4 The Mozi often employs the literary device of an unnamed interlocutor to carry forth the dialogue.

 This is why it is the proper work of kings, dukes, and great officers to increase the number of worthy men in their states.” Since this is the case, what is the best way to go about increasing the number of worthy men? Our teacher Mozi says, “It is analogous to the case of wanting to increase the number of good archers or charioteers in one’s state. One must reward and esteem them, revere and praise them; then one can succeed in increas- ing the number of good archers or charioteers in one’s state. How much more should this be done in the case of worthy men—those who are well versed in virtuous conduct, discriminating in discussion, and broadly knowledgeable! Such men are state treasures, guardians of the altars to the soil and grain. 5 They too must be rewarded and esteemed, revered and praised; then one can succeed in increasing the number of worthy men in one’s state.

 “This is why in ancient times, when the sage-kings ruled, they an- nounced that: 

```latex
Those who are not righteous, I shall not enrich. 

Those who are not righteous, I shall not esteem. 

Those who are not righteous, I shall not regard as kin.

Those who are not righteous, I shall not get close to. 
```

When the wealthy and eminent in the state heard this they retired and thought to themselves, ‘At first, we could rely on our wealth and eminence, but now the king promotes the righteous and does not turn away the poor and the humble. This being the case, we too must be righteous.’ When the king’s relatives heard this they retired and thought to themselves, ‘At first, we could rely on being royal kin, but now the king promotes the righteous and does not turn away the most distant relations. This being the case, we too must be righteous.’ When those close to the king heard this they retired and thought to themselves, ‘At first, we could rely on being close to the king, but now the king promotes the righteous and does not turn away those far re- moved from him. This being the case, we too must be righteous.’ When those far removed from the king heard this they too retired and thought to themselves, ‘At first, we thought that being far removed from the king meant 

> 5 The site of important state sacrifices and often used as a metaphor for the foundation and stability of the state. Cf. Mozi’s various references to this and other sacrificial sites in “On Ghosts.” See Mozi , chapter 31, pp. 90–100.

mozi ■ 59 we had nothing to rely upon, but now the king promotes the righteous and does not turn away those far removed from him. This being the case, we too must be righteous.’ The word spread to those serving in distant cities and outlying regions, to the sons of nobles serving within the court, to all those within the capital, and on out to the common people throughout the four corners of the kingdom. Hearing this, they all strove to be righteous.” What is the reason for such success? Our teacher Mozi says, “Because those above employed those below for only one reason and those below served those above in only one way. 6 This state of affairs can be compared to the case of a rich man who builds a high wall around his house. Once the wall is complete, he has it cut through in one place and uses this for his door. If a thief should enter, the rich man can close the door and search for the thief, knowing that he has no way to escape. Why? Because the rich man has secured what is most vital. “This is why in ancient times, when the sage-kings ruled, they promoted the virtuous and honored the worthy. Even someone who worked as a farmer, artisan, or merchant, if they had talent they were promoted, given high rank and a handsome salary, entrusted with responsibility, and em- powered to have their orders obeyed. The sage-kings said, ‘If their rank is not high, the people will not revere them. If their salary is not substantial, the people will not put trust in them. If their orders are not empowered with authority, the people will not hold them in awe.’ These three things were given to the worthy not as rewards but in order to help them com- plete their duties. “And so, at that time, rank was awarded on the basis of virtue, work was assigned according to office, reward was distributed according to the amount of labor done, and salary allotted in proportion to the effort ex- pended. And so officials were not guaranteed constant nobility and people did not have to perpetually remain in a humble state. Those with ability were promoted, those without ability were demoted. This is what it means to, ‘Promote public righteousness and prevent private resentment.’ 7 “And so, in ancient times, Yao promoted Shun from southern Fuyang, 8 entrusted him with the administration of his kingdom, and the world was at peace.Yu promoted Yi from central Yinfang, entrusted him with the ad- ministration of his kingdom, and the nine realms were brought to perfec- 6 That is, people were evaluated and served only on the basis of their righteousness. 7 This seems to have been a recognizable political slogan of the time. 8 A place of uncertain location.

60 ■ mozi tion. 9 Tang promoted Yi Yin from among the cooks in his kitchen, en- trusted him with the administration of his kingdom, and his plans all were successful.King Wen promoted Hong Yao and Tai Yi from their work with rabbit snares, entrusted them with the administration of his kingdom, and the western territories submitted peacefully. 10 And so, at that time, even among those ministers with substantial salaries and prestigious positions, none failed to be reverent and cautious in carrying out their duties, and even among the farmers, craftsmen, and merchants, none failed to exert themselves in honoring virtue. “And so good men should be employed as capable assistants and respon- sible agents. If a ruler is able to retain such men, then his plans will not be frustrated nor his body wearied with work. A ruler’s fame shall be assured and his work successfully completed, his best tendencies will flourish and his worst shall not take form all because he retains the support of good men.” This is why our teacher Mozi says, “When things are going well, you must promote worthy men. When things are not going well, you must pro- mote worthy men. And if you would reverently carry on the Way of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang,then you must honor the worthy. Honoring the wor- thy is the root and basis of good government.” 

##Chapter Eleven: Obeying One’s Superior 

Our teacher Mozi says, “In ancient times, when people first came into being and before there were governments or laws, each person followed their own norm 11 for deciding what was right and wrong. 12 And so where 

> 9 Yi is Bo Yi `a (not to be confused with the brother of Shu Qi—see Important Fig- ures ). Bo Yi assisted Yu in his flood-control work and served him as an exemplary minister. Yinfang is a place of uncertain location. According to an ancient system of territorial divi- sion, China consisted of “nine realms.” 10 Hong Yao and Tai Yi were gamekeepers for King Wen. Technically, “rabbit snares” should be rendered “rabbit nets.” See selection # 177 ( Mao # 278) in Arthur Waley, The Book of Songs (London: Allen and Unwin, 1952) for a poem singing the praises of such a gamekeeper, describing him as a fitting companion and confidant for a king. (Note: The Book of Songs is Waley’s translation of the classic referred to in this volume as the Odes ). 11 The character yi ? that I here translate as “norm” (for deciding what is right and wrong) is often rendered as “right” or “righteousness” (see Important Terms ). The senses are clearly related, but the context here argues for “norm” as more appropriate. 12 “Right and wrong” is the translation of the Chinese terms shi/fei bc . Below, these terms are rendered verbally as “to approve” and “to condemn.” Cf. Mengzi 2A6 and n. 27 to that passage.

mozi ■ 61 there was one person there was one norm, where there were two people there were two norms, where there were ten people there were ten different norms. As many people as there were, that was how many norms were rec- ognized. In this way people came to approve their own norms for what is right and wrong and thereby condemn the norms of others. And so they mutually condemned each other’s norms. For this reason, within families, there was resentment and hatred between fathers and sons and elder and younger brothers that caused them to separate and disperse and made it impossible for them to cooperate harmoniously with one another. Throughout the world, people used water, fire, and poison to harm and in- jure one another, to the point where if they had strength to spare, they would not use it to help each other, if they had excess goods, they would leave them to rot away rather than distribute them to one another, and if they had helpful teachings, they would hide them away rather than teach them to one another. The chaos that ruled in the world was like what one finds among the birds and beasts. “Those who understood the nature of this chaos saw that it arose from a lack of rulers and leaders and so they chose the best person among the most worthy and capable in the world and established him as the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven was established, but because his strength was not sufficient for the task of ruling the entire world, they chose among the most worthy and capable in the world and installed the best among them as the three imperial ministers. The Son of Heaven and three imperial min- isters were established, but because the world is so vast it was impossible for them to know and judge in each case what would be right or wrong, ben- eficial or harmful for the people of distant states and different regions. And so they divided up the myriad states and established feudal lords and rulers. The feudal lords and rulers were established, but because their strength was not sufficient for the task before them, they chose among the most worthy and capable in the world and installed them as governors and leaders. “Once the governors and leaders were in place, the Son of Heaven an- nounced his rule to the people of the world saying, ‘Whenever you hear of something good or bad, always inform your superior. Whenever your supe- rior approves of something as right you too must approve of it. Whenever your superior condemns something as wrong you too must condemn it. Should a superior commit any transgression, one must offer proper remon- strance. Should your subordinates do anything good, one must widely rec- ommend them. To obey one’s superior and to avoid joining together with those in subordinate positions—such conduct will be rewarded by superiors

62 ■ mozi and praised by subordinates. But if you hear of something good or bad and fail to inform your superior, if you are not able to approve of what your su- perior approves of and condemn what your superior rejects, if you do not offer proper remonstrance when a superior commits a transgression and do not widely recommend subordinates who do good, if you do not obey your superior and you join together with those in subordinate positions–such con- duct will be punished by superiors and denounced by the people. This is how superiors shall determine rewards and punishments and they shall make care- ful examinations to ensure that their judgments are reliable.’ “And so, the leader of each village would be the most benevolent person in the village. When he announced his rule to the people of the village he would say, ‘Whenever you hear of anything either good or bad, you must report it to the head of the district. Whenever the head of the district ap- proves of something all of you must also approve of it. Whenever the head of the district condemns something all of you must also condemn it. Elim- inate any bad teachings that you may have and study the good teachings of the head of the district. Eliminate any bad practices that you may have and study the good practices of the head of the district. If you do this then how could the district ever become disordered?’ “If we look into how good order was maintained in the district, what do we find? Was it not simply because the leader of the district was able to unify the norms followed within the district that he was able to maintain good order in it? “The leader of each district would be the most benevolent person in the district. When he announced his rule to the people of the district he would say, ‘Whenever you hear of anything either good or bad, you must report it to the ruler of the state. Whenever the ruler of the state approves of some- thing all of you must also approve of it. Whenever the ruler of the state condemns something all of you must also condemn it. Eliminate any bad teachings that you may have and study the good teachings of the ruler of the state. Eliminate any bad practices that you may have and study the good practices of the ruler of the state. If you do this then how could the state ever become disordered?’ “If we look into how good order was maintained in the state, what do we find? Was it not simply because the ruler of the state was able to unify the norms followed within the state that he was able to maintain good order in it? “The ruler of each state would be the most benevolent person in the state. When he announced his rule to the people of the state he would say,

mozi ■ 63 ‘Whenever you hear of anything either good or bad, you must report it to the Son of Heaven. Whenever the Son of Heaven approves of something all of you must also approve of it. Whenever the Son of Heaven condemns something all of you must also condemn it. Eliminate any bad teachings that you may have and study the good teachings of the Son of Heaven. Eliminate any bad practices that you may have and study the good prac- tices of the Son of Heaven. If you do this then how could the world ever become disordered?’ “If we look into how good order was maintained in the world, what do we find? Was it not simply because the Son of Heaven was able to unify the norms followed within the world that he was able to maintain good order in it? “If the people of the world all obey their superiors on up to the Son of Heaven but do not obey Heaven, then Heavenly disasters still will not cease. Now, the hurricanes and torrential rains that regularly are visited upon the people is how Heaven punishes them for not obeying its will.” This is why our teacher Mozi says, “In ancient times, sage-kings created the Five Punishments 13 to facilitate good order among their people. These are like the main thread of a skein of silk or the drawstring of a net. They are how the sage-kings gathered in those in the world who refused to obey their superiors.” 

##Chapter Sixteen: Impartial Caring 

Our teacher Mozi says, “The business of a benevolent person is to promote what is beneficial to the world and eliminate what is harmful.” Granted that this is true, what are the greatest harms that are being done in the world today? Our teacher Mozi says, “It is things such as great states attacking small states, great families wreaking havoc with lesser families, the strong robbing the weak, the many doing violence to the few, the clever de- ceiving the ignorant, and the noble acting arrogantly toward the humble. These are some of the great harms being done in the world. In addition, there are rulers who are not kind, ministers who are not loyal, fathers who are not loving, and children who are not filial. These too are some of the great harms being done in the world. There are also those of low character 13 The Five Punishments are said to be tatooing the face, cutting off the nose, cutting off the feet, castration, and death.

64 ■ mozi who use weapons, poison, water, and fire to injure and steal from one an- other. These too are some of the great harms done in the world.” If we try to discover the origin of these different harms, where do we find they come from? Do they come from caring for and benefiting peo- ple? This clearly must be rejected as the origin of these harms. We must rec- ognize that they come from hating and stealing from people. If we wish to distinguish those in the world who hate and steal from people, do we refer to them as impartial or partial? We clearly must call them partial. And so it is those who are partial in their dealings with others who are the real cause of all the great harms in the world. This is why our teacher Mozi says, “I condemn partiality.” Now those who condemn another’s view must offer something in its place. If one condemns another’s view without offering something in its place this is like adding water to a flood or flame to a fire. Such appeals prove to have no merit. This is why our teacher Mozi says, “Replace partiality with impartiality.” Since this is what is correct, how then can we replace partiality with im- partiality? Our teacher Mozi says, “If people regarded other people’s states in the same way that they regard their own, who then would incite their own state to attack that of another? For one would do for others as one would do for oneself. If people regarded other people’s cities in the same way that they regard their own, who then would incite their own city to attack that of an- other? For one would do for others as one would do for oneself. If people regarded other people’s families in the same way that they regard their own, who then would incite their own family to attack that of another? For one would do for others as one would do for oneself. And so if states and cities do not attack one another and families do not wreak havoc upon and steal from one another, would this be a harm to the world or a benefit? Of course one must say it is a benefit to the world.” If we try to discover the source of these different benefits, where do we find they come from? Do they come from hating and stealing from people? This clearly must be rejected as the source of these benefits. We must rec- ognize that they come from caring for and benefitting people. If we wish to distinguish those in the world who care for and benefit people, do we refer to them as impartial or partial? We clearly must call them impartial. And so it is those who are impartial in their dealings with others who are the real cause of all the great benefits in the world.

mozi ■ 65 This is why our teacher Mozi says, “I approve of impartiality. Moreover, earlier I said that, ‘The business of a benevolent person is to promote what is beneficial to the world and eliminate what is harmful.’ And now I have shown that impartiality gives rise to all the great benefits in the world and that partiality gives rise to all the great harms in the world.” This is why our teacher Mozi says, “I condemn partiality and approve of impartiality for the reasons given above. If one takes impartiality as the cor- rect standard and truly seeks to promote and procure what is beneficial to the world, then those with sharp ears and keen eyes will listen and look out for others. Those with stout legs and strong arms will work for others, and those who understand the Way will educate and instruct others. And so men who reach old age without finding a wife and having children will get the support they need to live out their years. Young and helpless orphans, who are without father or mother, will find the support they need in order to reach maturity. Now such benefits can be attained only if impartiality is taken as the correct standard. And so I don’t see what reason any person in the world who has heard about impartiality can give for condemning it.” Though this is so, there are still people in the world who condemn im- partiality, saying, “It is surely a fine thing. Nevertheless, how can it possi- bly be applied?” Our teacher Mozi says, “If it could not be applied even I would condemn it! But is there really anything that is fine that cannot be put to use? Let us consider both sides of the matter. Suppose there were two people: one who maintains partiality and one who maintains impartiality. And so the person who maintains partiality would say, ‘How can I possibly regard the well- being of my friends as I do my own well-being? How can I possibly regard the parents of my friends as I do my own parents?’ And so when his friends are hungry, the partial person does not feed them. When his friends are cold, he does not clothe them. When his friends are ill, he does not nurture them. And when his friends die, he does not bury them. This is what the partial person says and what he does. But this is not what the impartial person says nor is this how he acts. The impartial person says, ‘I have heard that in order to be a superior person in the world, one must regard the well-being of one’s friends as one regards one’s own well-being; one must regard the parents of one’s friends as one regards one’s own parents. Only in this way can one be a superior person.’ And so when the impartial person’s friends are hungry, he feeds them. When his friends are cold, he clothes them. When his friends are ill, he nurtures them. And when his friends die, he buries them. This is what the impartial person says and what he does.

66 ■ mozi “Now the words of the two people that we have considered contradict each other and their actions are diametrically opposed. Let us suppose, though, that both are trustworthy in what they say and reliable in what they do. And so their words and deeds fit together like the two halves of a tally, and they always follow through and act on what they say. If we grant all of this, there is a further question I would like to ask. Suppose one must put on one’s armor and helmet and go to war in a vast and open wilderness where life and death are uncertain; or suppose one was sent by one’s ruler or high minister to the distant states of Ba, Yue, Qi, or Jing 14 and could not be sure of either reaching them or ever returning from one’s mission. Under such conditions of uncertainty, to whom would one entrust the well-being of one’s parents, wife, and children? Would one prefer that they be in the care of an impartial person or would one prefer that they be in the care of a partial person? I believe that under such circumstances, there are no fools in all the world. Even though one may not advocate impartiality, one would certainly want to entrust one’s family to the person who is impartial. But this is to condemn impartiality in word but prefer it in deed, with the result that one’s actions do not accord with what one says. And so I don’t see what reason any person in the world who has heard about impartiality can give for condemning it.” Though this is so, there are still people in the world who condemn im- partiality, saying, “It is an acceptable way for choosing reliable people but one can’t use it to choose one’s ruler.” Our teacher Mozi says, “Let us consider both sides of the matter. Suppose there were two rulers: one who maintains impartiality and one who main- tains partiality. And so the ruler who maintains partiality would say, ‘How can I possibly regard the well-being of my myriad subjects as I do my own well-being? This is profoundly at odds with the way people in the world feel. How brief is the span of a person’s life upon this earth! It rushes by like a galloping team of horses glimpsed through a crack!’ And so when his sub- jects are hungry, the partial ruler does not feed them. When his subjects are cold, he does not clothe them. When his subjects are ill, he does not nur- ture them. And when his subjects die, he does not bury them. This is what the partial ruler says and what he does. But this is not what the impartial ruler says nor is this how he acts. The impartial ruler says, ‘I have heard that in order to be an enlightened ruler in the world, one must first worry about 14 Ba, Yue, Qi, and Jing are four ancient states that were far removed from the center of Chinese civilization at the time.

mozi ■ 67 the well-being of one’s people and then worry about oneself. Only in this way can one be a enlightened ruler.’ And so when the impartial ruler’s peo- ple are hungry, he feeds them. When his people are cold, he clothes them. When his people are ill, he nurtures them. And when his people die, he buries them. This is what the impartial ruler says and what he does. “Now the words of the two rulers that we have considered contradict each other and their actions are diametrically opposed. Let us suppose, though, that both are trustworthy in what they say and reliable in what they do. And so their words and deeds fit together like the two halves of a tally, and they always follow through and act on what they say. If we grant all of this, there is a further question I would like to ask. Suppose there were a terrible epidemic in which most of the people suffered bitterly from hunger and cold and many lay dead and unburied in the ditches and gul- lies. 15 Between these two rulers, which one would the people then follow? I believe that under such circumstances, there are no fools in all the world. Even though one may not advocate impartiality, one would certainly want to follow the ruler who is impartial. But this is to condemn impartiality in word but prefer it in deed with the result that one’s actions do not accord with what one says. And so I don’t see what reason any person in the world who has heard about impartiality can give for condemning it.” Though this is so, there are still people in the world who condemn im- partiality saying, “Impartiality is benevolent and right but how can one practice it? The impossibility of practicing impartiality is like the impossi- bility of picking up Mount Tai and carrying it across the Chang Jiang or Huang He.” 16 And so impartiality is something they want to do but feel is impossible to practice. Our teacher Mozi says, “As for picking up Mount Tai and carrying it across the Chang Jiang or Huang He, this is something that no human being has ever done. But as for impartially caring for and benefitting one another, this is something that we know the four former sage-kings 17 them- selves practiced.” 15 People lying unburied in the ditches and gullies was a common trope used to illustrate a state of profound misrule. Cf. for example, Mengzi 1B12, 2B4. (not in this volume). 16 Picking up Mount Tai and carrying it across a vast expanse of water is a common trope for an impossible task. Cf. Mengzi 1A7 where the vast expanse of water is the North Sea. The Chang Jiang or “Yangtze River” and the Huang He or “Yellow River” are the largest rivers in central China. 17 Kings Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu.
