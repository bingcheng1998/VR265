Introduction to philosophy

Socrates never had wisdom completely, but was constantly striving after it.

How did he go about striving after wisdom?

Introduction to philosophy

Asking questions!!!

What types of questions does philosophy ask?

Introduction to philosophy

Each branch of philosophy deals With speciﬁc questions/problems:

1. What’s the nature of reality? (metaphysics)

2. What can I know/is knowledge? (epistemology)

3. What should I do — given some conception of the good? (ethics)

Introduction to philosophy

Branches of knowledge result from a convergence of questions and methodologies to

address those questions, for example, physics, economics, and psychology...

All knowledge, ultimately, comes from and can, therefore, be uniﬁed through philosophy.

Chinese philosophy

“...the Western word ‘philosophy’ is quite recent in Chinese; it was initially rendered into Chinese as zhexue in 1873 by the Japanese

scholar Xi Zhou (1829-1897) who studied in the Netherlands...

the initial character zhe means ‘knowledge’ or ‘capacity to acquire

knowledge’, with an extended meaning of wisdom; and the second character Xue means ‘learning’.

The Chinese term for ‘philosophy’ thus means ‘learning to become a wise and knowledgeable person.”’*

*Wang, N. (2013). “Philosophical perspectives on technology in Chinese Society.” Technology in Society 35. p. 165.

Chinese philosophy

“Before the word coinage by Xi Zhou, the abstract notion of philosophy was always

embedded in more speciﬁc neo-Confucianism terms created by Cheng Hao (1033-1107), Cheng Yi (1032-1085), and Zhu Xi (1130-1200), such as qiongli Xue (inquiry learning into the universe), Xingli Xue (theory of human nature), or li Xue (learning of principle).

In a note to explain why he decided to create zhexue to replace speciﬁc terms with a more general one, Xi Zhou wrote:

The original English Word for zhexue is philosophy, and the French word is philosophie. Both derive from the Greek word philosophos, which means the person who loves (philo) wisdom (sophos). The functional implication in the Chinese language is the so called ‘scholar who follows the example of the wise person’, according to a proposal by Zhou Dunyi in the Song dynasty. Later generations speciﬁcally identified philosophy [in general] with neo-Confucianism [a specific philosophy] and even literally translated the former as the doctrine of neo-Confucianism. In many instances, it is better to translate philosophy as zhexue in order to distinguish it from Confucianism in East Asia”*

What is culture?

What is culture?

Give three examples of things that are “cultural,” explaining what makes them so.

Close reading and critical thinking

—“AetiVe reading,” with a pen in hand

-Ask yourself: “What’s the main question/point of this reading/artie1e/section/paragraph?"

-Try to state it in your own Words, and look out for it in the text

—Use parentheses, a line in the margin — double lines for more important questions/points — or star to mark

-Deﬁnitions: Circle the Word, make a line in the margin, and an

“_99

— sign.

—Contrasts: Make a “/” between elements

—Claims you don’t understand/ﬁnd dubious/with which you disagree 9 Use a “?” with a note reminding you of the problem

-Make notes for other important thoughts/connections

“Culture in humans and other animals”

Q: What’s the main question of this article? A: What is culture?

Q: What’s the main point of this article? A: Culture is

not merely behaviors, ideas, beliefs, or other cultural Variants, i.e., things related to culture.

These are the kinds of things — and differences between them — that culture is supposed to explain. They’re phenotypic!

“Culture in humans and other animals”

An argument to refute this claim:

1. “Culture” should be able to explain (differences in) “behaviors, ideas, etc.”

2. Define/understand “culture” as “behaviors, ideas, etc.”

3. It follows, from 1. and 2., that “behaviors, ideas, etc.” explain “behaviors, ideas, etc.”

4. 3. is circular/seems absurd

5 . Hence, reject premise 2. — “culture” should not be deﬁned as “behaviors, ideas, etc.”

“Culture in humans and other animals”

In my own words: Culture is socially transmitted information that has long-term effects on the behaviors of individuals and groups.

In the text: “Culture is information [1] transmitted between individuals or groups [2], Where this information flows through

[3] and brings about the reproduction of [4], and a lasting change in [5], the behavioral trait” (Ramsey 466 — italics mine).

Culture is socially transmitted (2, 3?, 4?) information (1) that has long—term effects (5, 4) on the behaviors (3, 4) of individuals and groups.

“Culture in humans and other animals”

Hence, ﬁve criteria for the application of the term “culture,” along with critical clarifications/questions:

1. 2.

information: different types, BUT not a lack of information

transmitted between individuals/ groups — versus genes — BUT how transmitted? Ncludes ienvironments/“niche

transmitted through behaviors (“ﬂows through”) — BUT, what types of behaviors? Again, environments/“niche construction,” and teaching

reproduction of behavior — NOT the information itself, BUT to what extent/how perfectly?

causes lasting changes — how long?

“Culture and social behavior”

1. What’s the main question/point of this article? In my own words:

How do behaviors vary across human groups and why? Human behaviors are incredibly variable across groups (parts 1-3), as a result of social institutions (4-8), which are cultural.

2. In the text:

“Social behavior varies dramatically across human populations and throughout history” (84). “Let us consider four packages social norms — institutions — that have been linked to psychological difference” (86).

Some preliminaries — Economic games

—“economic” (phenomena related to market activities, such as fairness and cooperation)

-“games” (quantify behaviors — Versus mere judgments) l. Dictator game — allocate
2. Ultimatum game — allocate and (dis)agree
3. Cooperation game — put in and multiply

-Variations: anonymous Versus known, one-off Versus repeated, punishment: peer Versus bystandard

Some preliminaries — Cultural Variants

—Related to culture (remember: culture is INFORMATION, such that cultural Variants would be informational — carriers of information)

—For example, self concepts ~ how one thinks about oneself: independent Versus interdependent

—To date, “Values” have been the most Widely studied and conceived (cross-) cultural Variant. ..

—BUT, Values aren’t particularly/universally predictive of behaviors — high amounts of Variation in the relation between (reported) Values and (observed) actions

*Bardi & Schwartz 2003

Some preliminaries — Norms

In addition, a focus on norms:

“. . .a norm is a rule or principle [1] that specifies actions [2] that are required, permissible, or forbidden [3] independently of any legal or social institution [4]. Of course, some norms are also recognized and enforced by social institutions and laws, but the crucial point is that they needn't be... Very roughly, people are motivated to comply with norms as ultimate ends, rather than as a means to other ends; We'll refer to this type of motivation as intrinsic motivation [4]... People can also be motivated to comply With a norm for instrumental reasons, though intrinsic compliance motivation adds a substantial additional motivational force [We’ll return to this in debates between Confucians, Daoists, Mohists, and legalists]. Violations of norrns...typically engender punitive attitudes, like anger, condemnation, and blame, directed at the norm violator, and these attitudes sometimes lead to

punitive behavior [5]” (Sripada & Stich 2007).

Some preliminaries — Norms

Hence, five criteria for the application of the term “norm,” along with critical some clarifications/questions:

1. rule/principle — not necessarily ideational — i,e., involving a belief, idea, etc.

2. specifying actions — versus thoughts, beliefs, etc. BUT, these might not be unrelated. . .

3. speciﬁcation of: should, could, or should not — to date, the greatest amount of research has focused on the last one...

4. institutionally independent/intrinsically motivating — the relations between these two are not entirely clear...

5. punitive attitudes or punishing actions

Cooperation and punishment

—OWn words: Levels of cooperation (as measured by

mean contributions in cooperation games) and their “dynamics” (~whether these remain the same, go up, or

down, and the affects of punishment on these levels) are different among different groups in different places.

—In the text: Not really...

—Def1nitions?

Cooperation and punishment

-Information transmitted/how: If people will cooperate (contribute money — a behavior), how they will cooperate (how much money they contribute), and

Whether and to What extent people should cooperate (how and how much people punish)

—Lasting change in behavior: How likely people are to cooperate in the future — for example, group projects...

—Claims you don’t understand/ﬁnd dubious/with which you disagree?

Fairness and punishment

—OWn words: Perceptions of fairness (as measured by

mean offers made and accepted in ultimatum games) are different among different groups in different places.

—Def1nitions?

-Information transmitted/how: What people think is fair (how much they offer and rates at which people accept — behavior) and What people should think is fair (when an offer is rejected because it is too low/high)

Fairness and punishment

—Lasting change in behavior?

—C1aims you don’t understand/ﬁnd dubious/with which you disagree?

“The cultural evolution of prosocial religions”

Some preliminaries: A common tendency to conceive of religion in terms of belief in a supernatural God 6 orthodoxy

(=“right belief’)

Based on the inﬂuences (“success”) of the “Abrahamic” religions — those tracing their origins to Abraham — i.e., Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (6 & 8).

Throughout most of history/among most people, emphases within religion have been on orthopraxy (=“right practice”/behavior).

“The cultural evolution of prosocial religions”

1. What’s the main question/point of this article? In my own words:

How can cultural evolution explain the predominance of a particular type of religion and, therefore, large-scale human cooperation? Beliefs and practices associated with morally interested, super natural Watchers are adaptive.

2. In the text:

“We explain how a package of culturally evolved religious beliefs and practices characterized by increasingly potent, moralizing, supernatural agents, credible displays of faith, and other psychologically active elements conducive to social solidarity promoted high fertility rates and large—scale cooperation with co—religionists, often contributing to success in intergroup competition and conﬂict. In turn, prosocial religious beliefs and practices spread and aggregated as these successful groups expanded, or were copied by less successful groups” (1).

“The cultural evolution of prosocial religions”

Two questions:

1. How has it been possible for human societies to scale up so much/quickly? (Large, anonymous, and cooperative)

2. Why have ”prosocial”/“big gods” religions come to dominate the cultural landscape?

The two are related

“The cultural evolution of prosocial religions”

—Religion is prototypically cultural, Where individual/evolved psychology interacts with socially/behaviorally transmitted information, which changes how people behave over the long run.

—Form a mutually reinforcing feedback loop, like: cooking, long-distance running, precision throwing, and lactose tolerance.

The components — byproducts

1. Individual psychology: “(l) mentalizing [=attributing

minds to/being able to empathize with others] (Bering 2011; Frith & Frith 2003; Waytz et al. 2010), (2)

teleological [=purposiVeness] thinking (Kelemen 2004), and (3) mind-body dualism (Bloom 2007; Chudek et al.

2015)” (4).

2. We monitor and sanction each other — reputation concern — for example, learning and remembering

normative rules more easily than others

The components — byproducts

3. We are social learners/believe in others (more on pages 10-14):

“[A.] Content-based mechanisms, which lead to the selective retention and transmission of some mental representations [and behaviors] over others because of differences in their content (Boyer 2001; Sperber 1996). For example, emotionally evocative and socially relevant ideas are more memorable and, therefore, culturally contagious (Heath et al. 2001; Stubbersﬁeld et al. 2015; see also Broesch et al. 2014).

[B.] Context-based mechanisms (or model-based cultural learning biases), which arise from evolved psychological mechanisms that encourage learners to attend to and learn

from particular individuals (cultural models) based on cues such as skill, success, prestige, self—similarity (Henrich & Gil-White 2001), and trait frequency (Perreault et

al. 2012; Rendell et al. 2011).

[C.] Credibility-enhancing displays (CREDS), or learners’ sensitivity to cues that a cultural model is genuinely committed to his or her stated or advertised beliefs. If models engage in behaviors that would be unlikely if they privately held opposing

beliefs, learners are more likely to trust the sincerity of the models and, as a result, adopt their beliefs (Henrich 2009; see also Harris 2012; Sperber et al. 2010)” (5).

The components — byproducts

4. “Cultural group selection” (more on pages 14-16) — Groups that are more cooperative/internally cohesive will outperform those that are less:

“experimental evidence reveals that larger and more economically successful groups have stronger prosocial norms: a pattern consistent with cultural group

selection models. For example, in a global sample of roughly a dozen diverse populations, individuals from larger ethnolinguistic groups and larger communities were more willing to incur a cost to punish unfair offers in experimental games

(Henrich et al. 2010a; 2014), a result that held after controlling for a range of economic and demographic variables (see also Marlowe et al. 2008). Even among

Hadza foragers, larger camps are more often prosocial in economic games (Marlowe 2004)” (5).

“Cross-nationally, experimental work also reveals a negative correlation between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and both people’s motivations to punish cooperators in a public goods game (stiﬂing cooperation) and their willingness to

cheat to favor themselves or their local ‘in’ group (Hermann et al. 2008; Hruschka et al. 2014).”

Bringing it together

1. “Big Gods” become responsible for watching and reprimanding — lower costs for indiViduals/ groups

2. Behaviors heighten commitment to religious groups through feelings — for example, CRED’s (credibility enhancing displays), singing, and dancing

3. Beliefs and behaviors raise cooperation — for example, in- Versus out—group marking

China — Social stratiﬁcation. . .

“In China, for example, the beginning of the Bronze Age (ca. 1500 BCE [PEER — Shang dynasty]) is accompanied by a radical elaboration in tomb architecture and burial practices of elites, indicating the emergence of highly centralized and Stratiﬁed polities bound together by costly public religious ceremonies

(Thote 2009)” (8 — italics mine).

China — Supernatural monitoring. . .

“...although China has sometimes been portrayed as lacking moralizing gods, or even religion at all

(Ames & Rosemont 2009; Granet 1934), scholars in recent years have begun systematically correcting that misconception (Clark & Winslett 2011; Slingerland 20l3)... in the earliest Chinese

societies for which written records exist, the worshipped pantheon includes both the actual ancestors of the royal line and a variety of nature gods and cultural heroes, all under the dominion of a supreme

deity, the ‘Lord on High’ (shangdi [J:”nU‘]) or Heaven (tian [35]). This Lord on High/Heaven was a Big God in our sense, wielding supreme power over the natural world, intervening at will in the affairs of humans, and intensely concerned with prosocial values. The ability of the royal family to

rule was a direct result of its possessing the ‘Mandate’ (lit. ‘order or ‘charge’) of Heaven [3E’n°rJ‘} , the possession of which was — at least by 1000 BCE or thereabouts — seen as being linked to moral

behavior Hg} and proper observance of costly sacriﬁcial and other ritual duties... Even from the

sparse records from the Shang Dynasty, it is apparent that the uniquely broad power of the Lord on High to command a variety of events in the world led the Shang kings to feel a particular urgency about placating Him with proper ritual offerings. When the Zhou polity began to fragment into a variety of independent, and often conﬂicting, states (770—256 BCE [Eastern Zhou = Spring and Autumn + Warring states F\J§=§$W + I5lZE|YJLi‘E]), supernatural surveillance and the threat of supernatural sanctions remained at the heart of interstate diplomacy and internal political and legal relations (Poo 2009). Finally, the written record reveals an increasingly clear connection in early China between morality and religious commitments. The outlines of moral behavior had been dictated by Heaven and encoded in a set of social norms, and a failure to adhere to these norms — either in outward behavior or in one’s inner life — was to invite supernatural punishment (Eno 2009)” (8).
