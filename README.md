**1. Course Description**

In the last thirty years, China has developed more and more quickly than any society in human history, resulting in inquiry into the basis of contemporary Chinese culture. In attempting to understand this basis, efforts have tended to focus on China’s differences from the West, as well as China’s history: In contradistinction to contemporary Western culture, that in China would be based on ancient Eastern paradigms, characterized in terms of figures, questions, and themes associated with the Chinese philosophical tradition.

To better understand these dynamics and their stakes, this course introduces Chinese philosophy, through reflection on the ways and extent to which Chinese philosophy serves as the basis for contemporary Chinese culture. It surveys Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and legalism, as well as psychological and anthropological accounts of the nature and evolution of culture. Towards these ends, emphasis will be given to not only the history of China and its philosophical tradition but also contemporary China and current social trends.

The course will focus on understand not only the manner and extent to which Chinese philosophy is related to Chinese culture, but also how Chinese philosophy has conceived of culture. In addition to those specific contents, the course will cultivate the general skills of close reading, critical thinking, and clear writing

**3. Course Requirements**

Rather than primarily lectures, the format of this course is based on out-of-class reading and reflection, as well as in-class discussion and exercises. The primary focus will be on discussions of and reflections on the assigned materials, as well as answering reflective questions and completing exercises related to the course readings. To contribute to class discussions in a meaningful way, it is important that you do the assigned readings before class. Additionally, you should always bring **paper** and a **writing utensil** to this course, since you should take notes, and there’ll be a variety of short writing/reflection exercises you’ll be required to turn in at the end of class.

 

**A. Reading/attendance quizzes and/or in-class exercises** **(20%)****:** To ensure you attend class, have done and understood the reading, and as a jumping-off point for class discussion, some classes will begin with a short (one to two questions) quiz, concerning the assigned reading for that day, personal reflection, and/or the content covered in the previous class. You will have **seven** minutes to complete the quiz, beginning from the time the bell rings. For that reason, you should arrive to class **on time**, **putting away** everything except a piece of paper and writing utensil, **before** the class and quiz begin. On other days, this part of your grade will be based on individual or group in-class reflection/writing exercises. 

 

According to JI regulations, class attendance is **required**, and students who miss over 1/3 of classes **cannot pass**. Participation consists in not only attendance but also, for example, answering questions, asking questions, and completing exercises. You are responsible for all the material covered in class, including lecture content, schedule and policy changes, and other general information. (TIP: Be sure to ask for the contact information of several classmates so you can contact them about what you missed.)

 

To quote the JI policy on leave/missed classes:

a) “An advance request for leave of absence is required if the student cannot attend the class due to illness or other reasons. Absence without approval will be regarded as skipping classes.”

b) “A note that a student visited a medical facility is not a sufficient excuse for missing an assignment. The note must specifically indicate that the student was incapable of completing an assignment due to medical problems and that this condition was sudden enough that it was impractical to contact the instructor in advance.”

 

Even with an excused absence, you are required to hand in any work due for the class on time. For example, if you have an approved leave of absence on Monday, you are responsible for handing in any homework at the same time as other students.

 

As research indicates that students learn conceptual content better through taking notes by hand, **you should not use your laptop/tablet in class.** **Check the syllabus and Canvas regularly to keep up with assignments and other information related to the course.** Your lowest **two** reading/attendance quizzes and in-class exercises grades will be **dropped**.

 

**B. Cultural/empirical assessment stories/questions (CEASQ)** **(50%):** Based on the philosophical readings, students will complete writing assignments, consisting in formulating stories/questions to assess the extent to which individuals would subscribe to specific cultural variants – for example, ideas, beliefs, and values – covered in the readings, as well as identifying and discussing empirical claims made by the texts. These should be at least two pages but no longer than four pages. You will be assessed on **form** as much as **content** **– i.e., that your writing follows the conventions of the English language and are free of punctuation, grammar, and syntactical mistakes. These will be related to what we discuss in class so, again, take notes.** Check the **guidelines/grading criteria** for your written work posted on Canvas. If writing is especially troublesome for you, then I encourage you to seek help from the JI’s Writing Center. All late work will be penalized **ten-percentage points** per day. No papers handed in more than **four** days late will be accepted. **Always both submit e-versions and bring hardcopies to class.**

 

**C. Final exam (30%)**: The final exam will be closed book, closed notes, with short answer questions drawn from the readings, quizzes, homework, essays, lectures, *and class discussions*. **For this reason, it is absolutely necessary – not only for your participation grade but also for exam performance – that you attend** **all** **classes, or get notes from someone you trust for classes you miss.** The final exam will be cumulative.

 

**4. Grading Policy**

Reading/attendance quizzes and/or in-class exercises	20%

Cultural/empirical assessment stories/questions	50%

Final exam 	30%

 

Grades will be assigned according to this chart:

| Final average | Course grade | Final average  | Course grade |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| 98% and above | A+           | 77% and above  | C+           |
| 93% and above | A            | 73% and above  | C            |
| 90% and above | A-           | 70% and above  | C-           |
| 87% and above | B+           | 60% and above  | D            |
| 83% and above | B            | 59.9 and below | F            |
| 80% and above | B-           |                |              |

 

**5. Academic Integrity**

All work handed in for this class must be your own. The inclusion of any data, words, or ideas from any other source must be acknowledged, and that source must be given proper credit. Failure to do so is a violation of the Honor Code. Any suspected violation of the Honor Code will be reported to Honor Council for investigation. **In addition to any sanctions you might receive from the Honor Council, plagiarism will result in a failing grade on the assignment, as it will be deemed to have not been satisfactorily completed****.** For this course, plagiarism is defined as:

a) The use of any passage of **three words or longer** from another source without proper attribution. Use of any phrase of three words or more must be enclosed in quotation marks (“**example, example, example**”). The source of the material must be identified in the text, by a parenthetical reference, footnote, or endnote. 

b) Use of material from an uncredited source, making very minor changes (like word order or verb tense) to avoid the three-word rule.

c) Inclusion of **facts**, **data**, **ideas,** or **theories** originally thought of by someone else, without giving that person (organization, etc.) credit. You must identify the source, whether in an endnote, footnote, parenthetical reference, or in the text.

d) **Paraphrasing** ideas or theories (writing them in your own words) without giving the original thinker proper credit. 

e) Allowing another person to make extensive changes to your paper. This is considered “unauthorized aid.” (Allowing a friend to check your work for minor errors is fine.)

f) Use of an electronic translation program such as Google Translate. The use of machine translation programs is classified as “unauthorized aid.”  

 

Even assignments that you have struggled with will probably result in a grade higher than that of plagiarized work. If you have any questions about what constitutes or how to avoid plagiarism, please do not hesitate to ask.

 

**6. Language**

As long as students are in the classroom, they should speak English. Students should also speak English when meeting with me or the TA. If students must ask for the definition of an English word, this should be done in English. I will ask students not speaking in English to leave class.

 

**7. Courtesy**

Please foster a learning atmosphere by respecting classmates, TA’s, and the teacher. Students are asked to turn off their cell phones when class begins. Please do not play with electronic devices during class. Please be polite to other students. Any discussions about grades should take place calmly. It is recommended that students wait twenty-four hours before contacting an instructor or TA about a disputed grade. Again, I will ask students speaking out of turn or being disruptive to leave class.

 

*This syllabus is tentative and subject to revision as the instructor sees fit.
